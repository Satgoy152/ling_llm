I'll be happy to help you solve these computational linguistics problems. Let's go through them one by one.

### Problem 1: Braille

For this problem, we need to analyze the given Braille patterns and deduce the rules for translating English to Braille. Then we can apply these rules to the given sentence.

Key observations:
1. Each Braille character consists of 6 dots (2 columns, 3 rows).
2. Capital letters are preceded by a special character (⠠).
3. Numbers are preceded by a special character (⠼).
4. Punctuation marks have their own Braille representations.

Now, let's translate "Bring 40 pizzas and vermouth, Mark!" to Braille:

⠠⠃⠗⠊⠝⠛ ⠼⠙⠚ ⠏⠊⠵⠵⠁⠎ ⠁⠝⠙ ⠧⠑⠗⠍⠕⠥⠞⠓⠂ ⠠⠍⠁⠗⠅⠖

### Problem 2: Movima Language

§1. The combination "n"" stands for a single specific consonant in Movima.

§2. Filling in the gaps:

| Base Form              | Negative Form          |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| as                     | kas asa:sa'            |
| enferme:ra             | kas enferme:ra:ra'     |
| ji#a:pa                | kas jika'#a:pa         |
| de                     | kas deka:ka'           |
| rulrul                 | kas rula'rul           |
| tipoysu:da             | kas tipoka'ysu:da      |

### Problem 3: Georgian Verb Forms

After analyzing the patterns, here are the correct correspondences:

1. vtkvi - I said
2. kenit - you (pl.) did
3. inadiret - you (pl.) hunted
4. itavmGdomareve - you presided
5. vsadilobt - we dine
6. tkvi - you said
7. vigoreb - I will roll
8. vkeni - I did
9. nadirob - you hunt
10. visadileb - I will dine
11. vinadire - I hunted
12. ambob - you say
13. vitavmGdomareve - I presided
14. izamt - you (pl.) will do
15. vivlit - we will walk

### Problem 4: Ndom Language Squares

§1. Determining which is which:
1 = nif
2 = mer
3 = thonith
4 = nif abo nif
5 = nif thef
6 = nif abo mer
7 = nif thef abo mer
8 = nif abo thonith
9 = nif thef abo nif
10 = mer abo sas

§2. mer abo sas × meregh = tondor abo mer an thef abo meregh
In numerals: 10 × 4 = 40

§3. In numerals:
nif ithin abo ithin = 11
mer an thef abo meregh = 14

§4. In Ndom:
58 = nif thef abo nif abo ithin
87 = nif thef abo nif abo mer thef abo nif

### Problem 5: Turkish and Tatar

Filling in the gaps:
