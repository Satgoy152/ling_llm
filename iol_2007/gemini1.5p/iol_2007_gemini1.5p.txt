## Solutions to Computational Linguistics Problems

Here are the solutions to the problems presented, incorporating explanations for clarity:

**Problem 1 (Braille Transcription)**

**(a) Write down in Braille: Bring 40 pizzas and vermouth, Mark!**

```
⠠⠃⠗⠊⠝⠛ ⠼⠙⠼⠚ ⠏⠊⠵⠵⠁⠎ ⠁⠝⠙ ⠧⠑⠗⠍⠕⠥⠞⠓⠂ ⠠⠍⠁⠗⠅⠖
```

**Explanation:**

* We utilize the Braille alphabet provided to directly translate each letter.
* Notice the number sign "⠼" preceding numerals 4 and 0. This is essential in Braille to distinguish numbers from letters.

**Problem 2 (Movima Language Analysis)**

**§1. Which letter combination always stands for a single specific consonant in Movima?**

The combination **"ka"** consistently represents a single consonant sound in Movima. This is evident in the negative form, where "kas" precedes every negated verb, indicating "ka" doesn't function as two separate sounds.

**§2. Fill in the gaps (Negative Forms):**

| Base Form              | Negative Form      |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| as                     | **kas asa:’**        | 
| enferme:ra             | **kas enferme:ra:’** |
| ji#a:pa                | **kas ji#a:paka’**   |
| de                     | **kas de:’**         |
| rulrul                 | **kas rulru:’**      |
| tipoysu:da             | **kas tipoysu:da:’**|

**Explanation:**

We observe a pattern in forming negatives:

* A consistent "kas" precedes the base form.
* Often, a vowel (usually 'a') is added or elongated at the end of the base form. 

Applying this pattern, we can confidently fill the gaps.

**Problem 3 (Georgian Verb Conjugation)**

**Determine the correct correspondences between Georgian verb forms and their English translations:**

| Georgian Verb Form  | English Translation   |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| vtkvi               | you say              |
| kenit               | you (pl.) will do    |
| inadiret            | you hunt             |
| itavmGdomareve      | I presided           |
| vsadilobt           | you (pl.) did        |
| tkvi                | I said               |
| vigoreb             | you said             |
| vkeni               | I will dine          |
| nadirob             | we will walk         |
| visadileb           | you presided         |
| vinadire            | you (pl.) hunted     |
| ambob               | I will roll          |
| vitavmGdomareve    | I hunted             |
| izamt               | we dine              |
| vivlit              | you (pl.) say        |

**Explanation:**

While challenging without deeper linguistic knowledge, we can deduce several correspondences:

* **Pronouns:** Focus on identifying "I," "you," "we," and "you (pl.)" forms. The presence of "v" often indicates "you" forms.
* **Tense:** Look for consistent patterns indicating past (e.g., "-eb"), present (e.g., "-it"), and future (e.g., "-ob") tenses.

By carefully analyzing these cues, we can arrive at the most plausible correspondences.

**Problem 4 (Ndom Number System)**

**§1. Determine the Ndom words for the squares of numbers 1 to 10:**

| Ndom Word         | Numeral | Square |
|-------------------|---------|--------|
| nif               | 1       | 1      |
| mer               | 2       | 4      |
| thef              | 3       | 9      |
| abo               | +       |        |
| sas               | 5       | 25     |
| tondor            | 10      | 100    |
| ithin             | 4       | 16     |
| thonith           | 7       | 49     |
| meregh            | 6       | 36     |

**Explanation:**

* We begin by identifying "nif" as 1, as it's the simplest form. 
* We then decipher "mer" as 2, "thef" as 3, and "ithin" as 4 based on the increasing complexity of their squares.
* "abo" is deciphered as "+," as it connects numbers.
* We identify "sas" as 5, "tondor" as 10, "thonith" as 7, and "meregh" as 6 based on their calculated squares.

**§2. Write the equality "mer abo sas $ meregh = tondor abo mer an thef abo meregh" in numerals:**

2 + 5 * 6 = 10 + 2 * 3 + 6

**§3. Write "nif ithin abo ithin" and "mer an thef abo meregh" in numerals:**

* nif ithin abo ithin = 1 * 4 + 4 = **8**
* mer an thef abo meregh = 2 * 3 + 6 = **12**

**§4. Write 58 and 87 in Ndom:**

* 58 = 50 + 8 = tondor abo sas abo nif ithin abo ithin  
* 87 = 80 + 7 = tondor abo tondor abo tondor abo nif abo thonith

**Problem 5 (Turkish-Tatar Cognates)**

**Fill in the gaps:**

| bin                | мен            | mount!            |
| yumru              | йомры          | lump, swelling    |

**Explanation:**

We analyze the provided cognates to identify sound correspondences between Turkish and Tatar. For example:

* Turkish "b" often corresponds to Tatar "m" at the beginning of words.
* Turkish "d" frequently corresponds to Tatar "z" in the middle of words.

Utilizing these patterns and considering the provided translations, we can confidently fill the gaps.

**Note:** The Tatar words in the last five rows are written in Latin transliteration as accurate phonetic representation in the Latin alphabet is difficult without specialized fonts.
