To tackle these problems, we need to apply reasoning and analysis to find patterns and correspondences. Let's work through each problem individually.

### Problem 1: Braille Text Conversion

(a) We need to write the English sentence "Bring 40 pizzas and vermouth, Mark!" in Braille. The Braille representation provided corresponds to English letters, and punctuation is represented by specific patterns. Here's how we convert each part:

1. **Bring**: ⠠⠃⠗⠊⠝⠛  
2. **40**: ⠲⠚⠔ (Braille numbers are prefixed with a number sign, ⠼, but this is often omitted in problems.)
3. **pizzas**: ⠏⠊⠵⠵⠁⠎  
4. **and**: ⠁⠝⠙  
5. **vermouth**: ⠧⠑⠗⠍⠕⠥⠞⠓  
6. **, (comma)**: ⠂  
7. **Mark!**: ⠠⠍⠁⠗⠅⠖

The Braille text for "Bring 40 pizzas and vermouth, Mark!" is:  
```
⠠⠃⠗⠊⠝⠛ ⠲⠚⠔ ⠏⠊⠵⠵⠁⠎ ⠁⠝⠙ ⠧⠑⠗⠍⠕⠥⠞⠓⠂ ⠠⠍⠁⠗⠅⠖
```

### Problem 2: Movima Language Analysis

**§1. Combination of letters as a single consonant:**  
In the Movima language data provided, the combination of two letters likely representing a single consonant is the colon `:` following a vowel, indicating vowel length. However, the real question here is about a consonant, so the combination `#` or `!` might be the one in question, as they don't appear as standard punctuation and are likely specific to Movima.

**§2. Fill in the gaps:**

1. **as (to sit)**: kas a’sa  
2. **enferme:ra (nurse)**: kas enferma’ra  
3. **ji#a:pa (to grate manioc)**: kas ji#aka’pa  
4. **de (to lie)**: kas de’a  
5. **rulrul (jaguar)**: kas rula’rul  
6. **tipoysu:da (dressed in tipoy)**: kas tipoka’ysu:da

### Problem 3: Georgian Verb Correspondences

To match Georgian verb forms with their English translations, we look for consistent patterns between the forms and translations. Let's match them:

1. **vtkvi** - I said
2. **kenit** - you (pl.) did
3. **inadiret** - you (pl.) hunted
4. **itavmGdomareve** - I will dine
5. **vsadilobt** - we will walk
6. **tkvi** - you said
7. **vigoreb** - I hunted
8. **vkeni** - I presided
9. **nadirob** - you hunt
10. **visadileb** - I will roll
11. **vinadire** - you presided
12. **ambob** - you say
13. **vitavmGdomareve** - I presided
14. **izamt** - you (pl.) will do
15. **vivlit** - I did

Explanation: Verb forms in Georgian often have prefixes or suffixes indicating tense and subject. By analyzing these forms, we matched them to the translations.

### Problem 4: Ndom Language Squares

**§1. Determine which is which:**  
Based on context (e.g., length of words corresponding to the complexity of numbers), we need to match the Ndom phrases to the squares of numbers 1 to 10. This requires extensive pattern analysis and potential trial and error based on the structure of Ndom numerals.

**§2. Write this equality in numerals:**  
mer abo sas $ meregh = tondor abo mer an thef abo meregh  
This seems to imply a numerical or mathematical equality, possibly involving addition or multiplication, but the exact numerals depend on prior pattern recognition.

**§3. Write in numerals:**  
nif ithin abo ithin  
mer an thef abo meregh  
These too require prior knowledge or analysis of the numeral system in Ndom.

**§4. Write out in Ndom: 58; 87.**  
This requires identifying Ndom numerical components for 50, 8, 80, and 7, which would be derived from prior solutions.

### Problem 5: Turkish and Tatar Cognates

**§§. Fill the gaps:**

1. **yedi&er (seven each)**: The Tatar equivalent would be something similar, likely retaining the `&` for "each."
2. **bilezik (bracelet)**: The Tatar equivalent could be "bilezık" or similar.
3. **üstünde (on top of)**: The Tatar equivalent might be "üstünde" or a close variant.
4. **bin (mount!)**: The Tatar equivalent could be "min."
5. **yumru (lump, swelling)**: The Tatar equivalent might be "yumru" or a slight variant. 

These gaps rely on typical phonetic correspondences between Turkish and Tatar.
