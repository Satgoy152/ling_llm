Here are the solutions to the linguistics problems:

### Problem 1 Solution

(a) English translations:
1. nonifibe - we are piercing him
2. halu'ibe - you both will strike him 
3. lifilatagihe - because you both will pierce us
4. nokufune - we are piercing you(sg)
5. nolahanagihe - because I will strike you(pl)  

(b) Benabena translations:
1. you both are striking him - noho'ibe
2. we will pierce you(sg) - kahafune  
3. because we are striking you(pl) - nohalunagihe
4. because you(pl) will pierce him - lefilutagihe



Verb Structure: (object)-stem-(tense/aspect)-(subject)-(case)
- Object prefixes: 
  - no- 1sg object 
  - le- 2pl object
  - Ø- 3sg object
- Verb stems:
  - -ho(be)- "strike"
  - -fu(ne)- "pierce" 
- Tense/Aspect suffixes:
  - -Ø- present
  - -l(u/a)- future  
  - -'i- present dual subject
  - -fi- future dual subject
- Subject suffixes:  
  - -be 1pl 
  - -ne 1pl>2sg
  - -Ø 2sg/3sg
  - -lu 2pl>1
  - -na 1sg>2pl
  - -'i 3dl
  - -fi 2dl/1dl>2
- Other suffixes:
  - -tagihe "because"
  - -gihe "because" (after vowel)


The data shows an ergative-absolutive alignment, where the verb agrees with the absolutive argument (object of transitives, subject of intransitives). The "strike" verb has suppletive stems for different subject numbers.

Number marking patterns:
- Most nouns take -gↄ in the plural
- Some nouns are unmarked in the singular and take -dↄ in dual/plural
- Some animate nouns take -n in the dual 
- Irregular patterns: suppletion (e/alↄsↄhje), apophony (pʰↄ/pʰaa, kʰↄ/kʰↄdↄ) 



### Problem 3 Solution

(a) The reconstructed family tree:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[1st Gen Male] --- B[1st Gen Female]
    C[2nd Gen Male 1] --- D[2nd Gen Female 1] 
    E[2nd Gen Male 2] --- F[2nd Gen Female 2]
    A --- C
    A --- E
    B --- D
    B --- F
    C --- H[Lhie²nyn²]
    C --- I[Sie1tsie1]
    D --- J[Ldiu²±e1]  
    D --- K[Ke.i1¹ey²]
    E --- L[Ngon²ngwe1]
    E --- M[Mbe²phon1 ♂] 
    F --- N[Wa²nie1 ♀]
    F --- O[Syn1mei1 ♀]
    H --- P[Nie²tse.1 ♂] 
    H --- Q[Ngwi1mbyn² ?]
    J --- R[Sei1na1 ♀]
    J --- S[Œan1nia1 ♀]
```

Kinship terms:
- 'i@1 - father
- mu1 - mother's brother 
- wiej² - father's brother's child
- wia1 - father's sister's child
- ¹we.j1 - mother's sister's child
- ndo.n1 - mother's brother's child
- lio² - father's sister's child's child
- kâ.j1 - mother's sister's daughter's child
- ny1 - mother's mother's sister's son's child
- ma1 - mother's father's sister's son's son
- la² - mother's father's brother's daughter's son 

(b) The blank in the last sentence should be filled with "lio²".



### Problem 4 Solution

(a) English translations:
8. Did this man frighten the thief?
   The girl said that he[this man] frightened the thief.

9. Did the deceived girl not kill this youth?
   The deceived girl said that she[the deceived girl] did not kill this youth.

10. This thief said that the child healed the man. 
    OR
    This thief said that the child would heal the man.

The ambiguity arises because Engenni doesn't mark future tense overtly in affirmative statements, only in questions and negated statements. So the verb "gbunono" could be interpreted as either past or future tense.

(b) Engenni translations:
11. okàá nu. amù ânò ki.nono a.modhyòmú ko�lomù a nò à?  
    a.mò wei ga ó. ki.nono a.modhyòmú ko�lomù â. nò.

12. a. vùràmú nu. amù ânò kí nwa. sese edèì à?  
    a. vùràmú nu. amù ânò wei ga òkí nwa. sese edèì.

(c) The base form of "thief" is most likely "ozyi". It appears in both subject and object positions without any additional marking (ozyi, ozyì).

The base form of "girl" is most likely "amemùrè". The form "amemùré" with a high tone on the last vowel seems to be a subject case form used with past tense verbs. The base form "amemùrè" is used elsewhere (e.g. in object position).



- SVO word order
- Tones mark grammatical distinctions (e.g. past vs non-past)
- Questions formed by a sentence-final particle "à" 
- Negation marked by "kí" (future) or "kí" + verb tone change (past) 
- Pronouns: 
  - ò "he" (human) 
  - ó. "she" (human)
- Tense/aspect:
  - Unmarked: non-future  
  - Future: Aux "ga" + irrealis mood (low tones)
  - Past: High tones on verb (and pronouns)
- Reported speech: "wei ga" + embedded clause


Engenni appears to be a tonal language with SVO basic word order and a nominative-accusative alignment. Tense/aspect/mood distinctions are marked by auxiliaries and tone. Reported speech uses a "say" verb and a subordinator.

(b) English translations:
- búmá zù - head hair
- kò - in, inside  
- lébé gòk - center of field
- lébé ẃı - in the middle, in the center

(c) Northwest Gbaya translations:
- at the center - nú lébé  
- head - zù
- displeasure - Páá d́ı sèè
- nose - zú ýık



Northwest Gbaya productively forms compounds:

- Body part + body part:  
  ýık "eye" + ẃı "field" = "good field"   
  d́ı "mouth" + sèè "pointed object" = "tip of the tongue"

- Body part + location:  
  kò "internal opening" + ýık "eye" = "eye socket"
  nú "at, on" + lébé "middle" = "at the surface"

- Verb + body part:  
  náng "to be attached" + nú "on" + kò "internal opening" = "to envy"  
  kò "internal opening" + zòk "death" = "to be dying"

- Modification: 
  búmá "hair" + ýık "face, eye" = "eyelash"
  búmá "hair" + zù "head" + ýık "face, eye" = "eyebrow"


The data reveals several productive compounding patterns in Northwest Gbaya involving body part terms, locatives, and verbs. Compounds encode various semantic relations between their components.
