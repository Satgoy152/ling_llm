# Problem 2

§1. The combination of two letters that always stands for a single specific consonant in Movima is "ch", which represents the sound /ʧ/.

§2. Here are the missing forms filled in:

| Base Form              | Translation             | Negative Form      |
|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| as                     | to sit                  | kas a:na'          |
| enferme:ra             | nurse                   | kas enferme:rana'  |

| dewaja                 | to see                  | kas dewaja'na      |
| deka'wajna             | to see traces of somebody| kas deka'wajna    |

# Problem 3

The correct correspondences are:

- vtkvi = I said
- kenit = you (pl.) did
- inadiret = you hunt
- itavmGdomareve = you presided
- vsadilobt = I will roll
- tkvi = you said
- vigoreb = I did
- vkeni = I did
- nadirob = I hunted
- visadileb = I will dine
- vinadire = I hunted
- ambob = I will say
- vitavmGdomareve = I presided
- izamt = you (pl.) will do
- vivlit = we will walk

This is the most plausible solution, as it matches the English translations with the Georgian verb forms in a consistent way.

# Problem 4

§1. Determining the correspondences:

nif = 1
abo = square of
mer = 2 
an = 3
thef = 4
sas = 5
tondor = 6
thonith = 7
ithin = 8
nif abo mer an thef abo sas = 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2
nif thef abo tondor abo mer abo thonith mer an thef abo thonith = 1^2, 4^2, 6^2, 2^2, 7^2, 2 * 3, 4^2, 7^2
nif = 1
mer abo ithin = 2^2, 8^2
thonith = 7
sas = 5
nif thef abo mer abo ithin = 1^2, 4^2, 2^2, 8^2
nif abo tondor abo mer abo thonith tondor abo mer abo sas = 1^2, 6^2, 2^2, 7^2, 6^2, 2^2, 5^2

§2. mer abo sas $ meregh = tondor abo mer an thef abo meregh
2^2 $ 25 = 6^2 * 2^2 * 4^2 * 25

§3. nif ithin abo ithin = 1^2 * 8^2
mer an thef abo meregh = 2^2 * 3^2 * 4^2 * 25

§4. 58 = mer abo sas = 2^2
