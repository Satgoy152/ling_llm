  Using this mapping, we must carefully assign each utterance according to the relationships described in the family tree. This requires understanding and translating the terms used in each utterance, such as "anthunha" (means), "wardu" (child), "nhuthi" (mother), and others.

(b) Fill in the blanks (i–ix):
- (i) "nhupa" — my father
- (ii) "lhuka" — my mother
- (iii) "wardu" — my child
- (iv) "nhuthi" — my mother
- (v) "wardu" — my child
- (vi) "kupaka" — my son
- (vii) "wardu" — my child
- (viii) "kupaka" — my son
- (ix) "wardu" — my child

### Solution to Problem 5: Proto-Chamic Language Analysis

(a) No descendant of the Proto-Chamic word *bala can be found in the present-day Tsat language. However, what would it have become if it had survived?

Based on the patterns of phonetic changes observed in other words, if *bala had survived into Tsat, it might have become "ɬaː" or "ɬaʔ". This is inferred by comparing patterns where initial consonants tend to drop or change minimally, the central vowels remain consistent, and final consonants are either dropped or simplified.

(b) Fill in the blanks (1–18):

1. skin — kiːli
2. black — haːmi
3. mouth — buːha
4. to tie — ʔikat
5. to tie — kiʔ⁴²
6. fathom — dəpa
7. fathom — dəpaː
8. to die — matay
9. to die — maːtʔ⁴²
10. inside — dalam
11. inside — laːmʔ⁴²
12. to fall down — labuh
