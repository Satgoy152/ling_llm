            LLM Answer: Mother-in-law (waymin) is the animal classified as "old women". The linguist thought the feminine marker "balan" was incorrect.
            Real Answer: The grasshopper is neither a woman nor a dangerous animal, but takes the same article, so it must be the “old woman” from the myth. The linguist thought that `baNgun bundiñéu` in example (14) was an error.
