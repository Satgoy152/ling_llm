I understand. I'll grade the LLM's answers based on the provided rubric and classifications. Here's the grading:

Problem 1:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: Animal: Scorpion, Linguist's Error: The linguist thought it was incorrect to classify "scorpion" in Class II (balan), typically reserved for female humans and associated items, but due to cultural myths, scorpions are considered "old women" and correctly placed in Class II.
            Real Answer: The grasshopper is neither a woman nor a dangerous animal, but takes the same article, so it must be the "old woman" from the myth. The linguist thought that `baNgun bundiñéu` in example (14) was an error.
