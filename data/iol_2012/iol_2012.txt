(a) A linguist thought there was an error in one of the Dyirbal sentences above. In fact there is no error. The explanation for what seemed strange to him is that one of the animal species is regarded as “old women” in one of the myths of the Dyirbal people. Which animal is it? What did the linguist consider to be an error?

(b) Translate into English:
17. balan ñalNga baNgul NumaNgu guniymuNagu bambunman.  
- (The young boy is being made tired by the man that is always bending.)

18. bala diban bilmbalmuNa baNgun biñéiriñéu guniñu.

19. bayi bargan baNgul yaóaNgu gubimbuluNunéanaymuNagu banéan.  
- (The quiet girl is following the doctor that is always being blamed.)

(c) Here are three more Dyirbal words:
- bayimbam — grub, caterpillar
- mugunanéa — aunt (mother’s elder sister)
- muNga — loud noise

Translate into Dyirbal:
20. The little wallaby is looking at the dragonfly.  
- bala yila guniñu baNgul duNangu buóan.

21. The aunt that is always being followed is bending the feather.  
- balan mugunanéa guliNgu NaéilmuNagu dimban.

22. The sleeping possum is ignoring the loud noise.  
- bayi yaóa munduNgu NaéilmuNagu muNgan.

23. The caterpillar is searching for the man that is always carrying stones.  
- bayi bayimbam guniñu baNgul yaóaNgu dibanbilmbalNaymuNagu.
