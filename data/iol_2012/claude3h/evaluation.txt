I understand. I will grade the LLM's answers based on the provided rubric and classifications. Please provide the LLM's answers for each problem so I can grade them accordingly.

Problem 1:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The animal species regarded as "old women" in the Dyirbal myths is the wallaby. The linguist considered the sentence "bala yila wura baNgul bargandu biNgundu guniñu" (The tired wallaby is searching for the little feather) to be an error, but it is in fact correct.
            Real Answer: The grasshopper is neither a woman nor a dangerous animal, but takes the same article, so it must be the “old woman” from the myth. The linguist thought that `baNgun bundiñéu` in example (14) was an error.
