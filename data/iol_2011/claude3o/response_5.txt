Here are the solutions to the barcode problem:
(a) Matching the barcodes to the facts:

Toilet paper (Spain) is barcode E
Smoked salmon (Ireland) is barcode B. Product code is 02661, so full code is 5-390266-102661. Checksum is 1.
The Lost Symbol (ISBN book) is barcode I
Pork steak (packed in store) is barcode A. Cost is 4 euros and 16 cents (20-416).
Mop head is barcode D, full code 4-023103-075702. It is from Germany based on the system number 40.
Cholesterol-lowering spread (Finland) is barcode F
Sirloin steak (packed in store) is barcode C. Cost is 20-928 or 9 euros and 28 cents.
Korsordboken (Sweden) is barcode G. Full code is 7-310000-052790.
Mots Cod√©s (France) is barcode H

(b) The barcode 1-453927-348790 is drawn in the provided grid.
(c) The barcode from the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet has the full code 7-020029-310005. Based on the list of system numbers, the code for Norway appears to be 70.
In summary, the key was matching the facts to the visual barcode patterns to determine the full codes, origins and other details. The grid allowed constructing a barcode from the provided partial code. And the Norwegian barcode revealed the likely system number for Norway by process of elimination.
