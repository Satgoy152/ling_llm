Let’s break down the problem based on the EAN-13 barcode format and the provided questions. Here’s a step-by-step approach to solving the different parts:

(a) Barcode Identification:

1. Toilet paper (Spain) is barcode E:

	•	The country code for Spain is 84. By looking at the grid and the bar patterns, barcode E will have the appropriate EAN-13 structure with the country code starting with 84.

2. Smoked salmon (Ireland), product code = 02661, checksum = ?:

	•	The system number for Ireland is 539. You need to compute the checksum for the code 539-02661.

The checksum for an EAN-13 barcode is calculated as follows:

	•	Multiply the digits in odd positions by 1 and the digits in even positions by 3.
	•	Sum the results.
	•	Subtract the sum from the next multiple of 10 to get the checksum.

Let’s calculate the checksum for 53902661:

	•	Odd positions: 5, 9, 0, 6, 1 → Sum = 5 + 0 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 21
	•	Even positions: 3, 3, 2, 6 → Sum = 3 × 3 + 2 × 3 + 6 × 3 = 9 + 6 + 18 = 33
	•	Total sum = 21 + 33 = 54
	•	The next multiple of 10 is 60, so the checksum = 60 - 54 = 6.

Hence, the checksum is 6.

3. The Lost Symbol (ISBN book):

	•	ISBN books use the system number 978. Look for a barcode in Img 5C that starts with 978. That would identify the barcode for The Lost Symbol.

4. Pork steak (packed in the store), cost = 4 euros and 16 cents:

	•	In-store items generally use the system number in the range 20–29. Find the barcode in Img 5C that matches this system number.

5. Mop head (from where?), full code = 4-023103-075702:

	•	The system number starting with 4 corresponds to Germany (system numbers 40-44). Therefore, the mop head is from Germany, and the barcode will start with 4.

6. Cholesterol-lowering spread (Finland):

	•	The system number for Finland is 64. Look for a barcode starting with 64 in Img 5C, which corresponds to Finland.

7. Sirloin steak (packed in the store), cost = ?:

	•	Similar to pork steak, in-store items use system numbers in the range 20–29. Look for the barcode in this range for the steak.

8. Korsordboken (puzzle magazine, Sweden), full code = ?:

	•	The system number for Sweden is 73. The full barcode will start with 73 and follow the EAN-13 structure. Look for this pattern in Img 5C.

9. Mots Codés (puzzle magazine, France):

	•	The system number for France is 30–37. Identify a barcode starting with one of these system numbers in Img 5C for the French puzzle magazine.

(b) Draw the barcode for 1-453927-348790:

	•	This barcode starts with 1. Based on the EAN-13 structure, you need to draw the grid as per the standard encoding. The left side will use odd parity, and the right side will use even parity encoding of digits.
	•	You can refer to Img 5D for the partially filled grid to complete this.

(c) Barcode from Dagbladet (Norway):

	•	To determine the system number or country code for Norway, examine the barcode in Img 5E. From the image, the barcode starts with a distinct system number.
	•	The system number for Norway can be inferred from the given barcode or external references (it’s likely in the range of 70–79, but needs confirmation).

You can manually match the barcodes in the images to the details provided in the problem and use the EAN-13 structure to finalize the answers. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of the points!
