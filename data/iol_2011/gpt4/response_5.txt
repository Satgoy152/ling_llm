It appears that the OCR (optical character recognition) did not successfully read the barcode numbers from the images. This means we will need to visually inspect the barcodes to identify the details.

Given this limitation, let’s proceed based on your problem’s description and visual identification of the system numbers:

Part A: Barcode Identification by Description

For each barcode:

	•	Barcode E has been identified as a product from Spain (system number 84).
	•	We need to identify the barcodes for other countries and products based on the system numbers you mentioned.

Part B: Drawing Imaginary Barcode

Given the structure, we will sketch out the barcode based on the format of EAN-13:

	•	Start, middle, and end guard bars (consisting of specific patterns).
	•	Left side odd/even numbered patterns.
	•	Right side always even numbered patterns.

Part C: Norwegian Barcode and System Number

Based on your description, the barcode for Dagbladet, a Norwegian newspaper, will be visually inspected to determine its full code and the system number for Norway.

Since OCR could not extract the barcode digits, we will need your help to provide or confirm the numbers or perform a visual assessment of the barcodes’ structures to proceed. Alternatively, we can simulate drawing a barcode based on typical EAN-13 formats for the imaginary barcode provided in part B of your problem. Let me know how you’d like to proceed or if you have additional information on the barcodes! ￼
