Problem 4:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: It is not possible to determine the placement of the stress for the following stems because they do not contain the stressed vowel marked with the acute accent (´) that is present in the other data: bhāg-a- 'share', pad-a- 'step', pat-i- 'lord', us-ri- 'morning light'
            Real Answer: This rule applies if the root contains precisely one stop consonant. If there are two (e.g., bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-) or none (us-ri-), the stress cannot be determined.
