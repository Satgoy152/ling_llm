Here are the solutions to the problems:

Problem 1:

(a) Translations into English:
1. a ksie a tgiang - 1 coconut 
2. o ngaitegaap a korlotge - 13 breadfruits
3. o ngausmia a ktiëk - 7 coconuts
4. o vuo a lo ktiëk hori orom a tgiang - 11 betel nuts

(b) Translations into Sulka:
1. 2 yams - a lo tu a lomin  
2. 14 yams - o sngu a ktiëk hori orom a korlolo
3. 15 breadfruits - o moulang a korlotge  
4. 20 betel nuts - o vuo a mhelom

The key observations are:
- Numbers 1-3 use special words. 4-9 are formed by adding numbers together.
- 10 is a lo X, 20 is X a mhelom 
- Hori orom means "plus"
- The order is number - object - number

Problem 3:

Based on the birthdate patterns, the matching of names to birthdates is:

Boys:
- Nwe si6þu - 06/14/2009  
- so mo cO - 06/16/2009
- yE au6 nai6 - 07/09/2009

Girls: 
- daliya - 06/24/2009
- e ti6 - 07/13/2009  
- phyuphyu wi6 - 07/18/2009

The key observations are:
- Boys tend to be born on odd days, girls on even days
- The name endings correlate with the birth month (e.g. au6 in July)

Problem 4:

(a) It's not possible to determine stress placement for those stems because:
- They don't have any long vowels or diphthongs which are always stressed
- They have multiple short vowels and no data to determine which one is stressed

(b) Stress marked stems:

- mr.dh-rá-
- phe-ná-  
- stú-ti-
- tán-ti-
- bhā́r-a-
- dū́-ta- 
- sváp-na-
- bhū́-mi-
- ghár-ma-
- ábh-ra-
- ghán-a-  
- ghr.s.-ví-

The key observations are:
- Long vowels and diphthongs are always stressed if present
- Otherwise the first vowel is stressed

Problem 5:

(a) English translations:
1. you make the woman love the carpenter / you make the carpenter love the woman 
2. he/she/it makes me shout
3. you beat him/her/it  
4. I sing the song for the healer
5. I want the atole
6. he/she/it makes you leave something 

(b) Nahuatl translations:
1. nēchchīhualtia in ātōlli
2. tiktēkāhuilia in oktli  
3. mitzkochitia in tīzītl
4. niklakēhua  
5. nihuetzi

The key observations are:
- Subject and object pronouns are prefixes
- "Something" is incorporated into the verb
- Causative is formed by suffixes -tia and -ltia
- Applicative (for someone) is formed by suffix -lia
