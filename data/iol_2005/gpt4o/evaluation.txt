            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: Saussure's Law: In Lithuanian, the accent shifts from the root syllable to the ending syllable if the original accent was on the root and the syllabic structure or stress rules of the language allow for such a shift, resulting in the splitting of paradigms.
            Real Answer: Saussure's Law states that if a word had a circumflex accent on its root in the singular, the accent would shift to the ending in the plural, creating the two subgroups of paradigms.
