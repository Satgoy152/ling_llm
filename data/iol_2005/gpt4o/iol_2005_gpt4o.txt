### Problem 5: Lithuanian Accent Paradigms

#### Assignment 1: Determine which accent paradigms originally belonged together

- Paradigms 1 and 3 likely belonged together initially.
- Paradigms 2 and 4 likely belonged together initially.

#### Assignment 2: Determine what the initial accent paradigms looked like

Initially:
- Paradigm for 1 and 3: Root syllable was consistently accented.
- Paradigm for 2 and 4: Ending syllable was accented.

#### Assignment 3: Formulate Saussure’s Law

Saussure’s Law: In Lithuanian, the accent shifts from the root syllable to the ending syllable if the original accent was on the root and the syllabic structure or stress rules of the language allow for such a shift, resulting in the splitting of paradigms.

Each problem has been analyzed using linguistic methodology, combining pattern recognition, syntax, and morphology to derive translations and understand language rules.
