Problem 1

a) Mark the long vowels (if any):

We need to identify and mark any long vowels (indicated by a colon “:”) in the given words.

	1.	mugaóumu (from a fishing net)
From the data, we observe that the suffix ”:m” means “from” as seen in “buña:m” (from a woman). Therefore, the word should be divided as:
	•	mugaóu:m
Since we have no indication of a long vowel in the root “mugaóu”, and considering that ”:m” is the suffix, there are no long vowels to mark in “mugaóu:m”.
	2.	waNalgu (for a boomerang)
The suffix ”:gu” indicates “for” as seen in “bama:gu” (for a person). Thus, the word should be:
	•	waNalg:gu
There is no long vowel indicated in the root “waNalg”. Therefore, there are no long vowels to mark in “waNalg:gu”.

Answer:

	•	mugaóu:m (no long vowels)
	•	waNalg:gu (no long vowels)

b) Mark the long vowels (if any) and translate into English:

	1.	baman
	•	Analysis: From “bama:gu” (for a person), we see that “bama” means “person”. The suffix ”:n” or ”:ni” indicates “of” as in “bimbi:n” (of a father). Therefore, the word is:
	•	bama:n
	•	Translation: “of a person”
	2.	buñabi
	•	Analysis: “buña” means “woman”. The suffix ”:bi” indicates “another” as in “bimbi:bi” (another father). There is no long vowel in “buña”.
	•	Translation: “another woman”
	3.	maéurmuéay
	•	Analysis: “maéu” means “frog”. The suffix “muéay” means “with” as in “éudu:lumuéay” (with a pigeon). The “r” may be part of the suffix indicating “another” (”:rbi” as in “maéu:rbi”). Therefore, the word can be broken down as:
	•	maéu:rmuéay
	•	Translation: “with another frog”
	4.	muéamni
	•	Analysis: “muéam” means “mother”. The suffix ”:ni” means “of”. There are no long vowels indicated.
	•	Translation: “of a mother”

Answer:

	1.	bama:n — “of a person”
	2.	buñabi — “another woman”
	3.	maéu:rmuéay — “with another frog”
	4.	muéamni — “of a mother”

c) Translate into Yidiny:

	1.	Of a stranger
	•	“stranger” in Yidiny is “muyubara”.
	•	The suffix ”:ni” means “of”.
	•	Translation: “muyubarini”
	2.	For a fishing net
	•	“fishing net” is “mugaóu”.
	•	The suffix ”:gu” means “for”.
	•	Translation: “mugaóu:gu”
	3.	Father
	•	“father” is “bimbi”.
	•	Translation: “bimbi”
	4.	From a frog
	•	“frog” is “maéu”.
	•	The suffix ”:m” means “from”.
	•	Translation: “maéu:m”
	5.	Without a man
	•	“man” is “wagu:éa” (but in the data, “man” is “wagu”).
	•	The suffix “gimbal” means “without”.
	•	Translation: “wagugimbal”
	6.	Of a pigeon
	•	“pigeon” is “éudu:lu”.
	•	The suffix ”:ni” means “of”.
	•	Translation: “éudu:luni”
	7.	Tortoise
	•	From “baéigalni” (of a tortoise), we get “baéigal”.
	•	Translation: “baéigal”
	8.	Without a boomerang
	•	“boomerang” is “waNalg”.
	•	The suffix “gimbal” means “without”.
	•	Translation: “waNalgimbal”

Problem 2

a) Determine the correct correspondences.

First, let’s match the Tundra Yukaghir words with their English translations by identifying common morphemes.

	•	Words for “nose”: In the list, “saancohoje” corresponds to “nose”.
	•	Words containing “johul”: From the data, “johul” seems to mean “bag”.
	•	Words with “ilen”: “ilennime” possibly refers to “gunshot”.
	•	Words with “cireme”: “cireme” could be “deer feed”.

Using these clues, let’s attempt to match the words:

	1.	ilennime — gunshot
	2.	joqonnime — wooden house (since “joqon” may be “wood”)
	3.	saancohoje — nose
	4.	johudawur — bird
	5.	ilenlegul — Yakut knife
	6.	cireme — deer feed
	7.	johul — bag
	8.	aariinmøŋer — rifle’s muzzle (since “møŋer” could be “muzzle”)
	9.	joqodile — horse
	10.	møŋer — muzzle
	11.	ciremennime — wooden house
	12.	joqoncohoje — grandchild
	13.	saadoŋoj — thunder
	14.	uoduo — Yakut person
	15.	oŋoj — cradle
	16.	aariinjohul — sack for provisions (since “aariin” may relate to “provisions”)
	17.	uodawur — wooden knife
	18.	joqol — nest

Due to the complexity, let’s suppose the following correspondences:

Tundra Yukaghir	English
ilennime	gunshot
joqonnime	wooden box
saancohoje	nose
johudawur	bird
ilenlegul	Yakut knife
cireme	deer feed
johul	bag
aariinmøŋer	rifle’s muzzle
joqodile	horse
møŋer	muzzle
ciremennime	wooden house
joqoncohoje	grandchild
saadoŋoj	thunder
uoduo	Yakut person
oŋoj	cradle
aariinjohul	herd of deer
uodawur	wooden knife
joqol	nest

b) Translate into English:

	1.	aarii
	•	Analysis: Given that “aariin” relates to “rifle” or “provisions”, and “aariinmøŋer” is “rifle’s muzzle”, perhaps “aarii” means “rifle”.
	•	Answer: “rifle”
	2.	aariidoŋoj
	•	Analysis: “doŋoj” appears in “saadoŋoj” (thunder), possibly meaning “sound”. So “aariidoŋoj” could be “rifle sound” or “gunshot”.
	•	Answer: “gunshot”
	3.	ciremedawur
	•	Analysis: “cireme” is “deer feed”, “dawur” could mean “bird” from “johudawur”. But likely “dawur” means “wooden”, so “ciremedawur” is “wooden deer feed”.
	•	Answer: “wooden deer feed”
	4.	ile
	•	Analysis: Appears in “ilennime” (gunshot), so “ile” may mean “gun”.
	•	Answer: “gun”
	5.	johudewce
	•	Analysis: “johudawur” is “bird”, “ewce” is “tip, point”, so “johudewce” is “bird’s beak”.
	•	Answer: “bird’s beak”
	6.	legul
	•	Analysis: Appears in “ilenlegul” (Yakut knife), so “legul” means “knife”.
	•	Answer: “knife”
	7.	saal
	•	Analysis: Possibly related to “saancohoje” (nose), but with limited data, we can suppose “saal” means “deer”.
	•	Answer: “deer”
	8.	saannime
	•	Analysis: “nime” might mean “case”, so “saannime” is “nose case”.
	•	Answer: “nose case”
	9.	uo
	•	Analysis: Appears in “uoduo” (Yakut person), so “uo” may mean “person”.
	•	Answer: “person”

c) Translate into Yukaghir:

	1.	Iron bird
	•	“Iron” is “cuo”, “bird” is “johudawur”.
	•	Translation: “cuo johudawur”
	2.	Snoring
	•	“Snoring” is related to “sleep” and “sound”. Without specific words, it’s challenging. Perhaps “ciremeewce” (since “ewce” is “tip”), but this seems unlikely.
	•	Given limited data, we might be unable to translate this accurately.
	3.	Tip of knife’s blade
	•	“Knife” is “legul”, “blade” might be “ilen” (from “ilennime”).
	•	“Tip” is “ewce”.
	•	Translation: “ilenlegulewce”
	4.	Sack for provisions
	•	“Sack” is “johul”, “provisions” could be “aariin”.
	•	Translation: “aariinjohul”

	•	Translation: “The demons will return to the women’s pupil.”

b) Translate into Muna:

	14.	The Ant will climb the pupil’s stone.

	•	“Ant” is “lagahi”, “will climb” is “dofoni”, “pupil’s” is “murindo”, “stone” is “kontuhi”.
	•	Translation: “Lagahi dofoni kontuhi murindo.”

	15.	The ants are going to the Demon.

	•	“Ants” is “lagahi”, “are going to” is “we”, “the Demon” is “adhiadhini”.

	•	Translation: “Andoandoke nododo lambuku robhineku.”

	17.	The monkey’s mountains are far.

	•	“Monkey’s” is “andoandoke”, “mountains” is “molo”, “are far” is “dokodoho”.
	•	Translation: “Molo andoandoke dokodoho.”

Problem 5

Determine the correct correspondences.

We need to match the words with their brain activity patterns.

First, analyze the known data:

	•	Location A high: Objects like airplane, apartment, igloo.
	•	Location B high: Objects involving tools or actions, like arm, screwdriver, key.
	•	Location C high: Food items like corn, cup, lettuce.
	•	Location D high: Items like airplane, apartment, lettuce, screwdriver.

Given this, we can deduce:

	•	Word 1: low, low, high, high — likely a food item associated with Location D — refrigerator.
	•	Word 2: low, low, high, low — possibly cat.
	•	Word 3: high, low, low, low — matches butterfly.
	•	Word 4: low, low, low, high — could be bed.
	•	Word 5: low, high, high, low — tool and food — spoon.
	•	Word 6: low, low, low, low — perhaps cow.

Final Answer:

	•	Word 1: refrigerator
	•	Word 2: cat
	•	Word 3: butterfly
	•	Word 4: bed
	•	Word 5: spoon
	•	Word 6: cow

Note: The above solutions are based on logical deductions from the given data, aiming to align translations and word correspondences accurately.
