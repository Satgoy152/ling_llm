To assist with transcribing the solutions from the 2013 International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) for your benchmarking project, I’ll summarize the solutions in the minimal way possible, while maintaining proper formatting and accents. Here’s the transcription for the five problems based on the provided solutions.

Problem 1 (Yidiny)

	1.	Rules:
	•	If the word’s syllable count is even, all syllables are short.

	•	(b) bama:n (of a person), buña:bi (another woman), maéurmuéay (with a frog), muéa:mni (of a mother).

	•	x = [P], noun + modifier are pronounced as one word.
	•	Primary stress is on the heaviest syllable type among the last three syllables of the word.
	2.	Solution:
	•	(a) xaaibi (thin) = [Pa.1ai.bi], xaapisi (arm) = [1Paa.pi.si], xitiixisi (fish) = [Pi.1tii.Pi.si].

	•	Cat: A = low, B = low, C = low, D = low.
