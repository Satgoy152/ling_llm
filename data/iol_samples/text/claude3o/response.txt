Here are the solutions to the computational linguistics problems:

Problem 2 - Ancient Greek

a. Matching:
A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4, E-5, F-6, G-7, H-8

b. Translations:
a) hoi tōn emporōn oicoi
b) hoi tu dulu onoi

The key observations are:
- The genitive case is marked by -u or -ōn endings 
- The definite article ho/hoi agrees in case with the following noun
- Nouns referring to people (cyrios, emporos, adephos, etc.) are masculine
- Nouns referring to things (oicos, onos) are masculine or neuter

Problem 3 - Aragonese

a. Missing plurals:
concordaus
chicolatz
chuntas
eclixes
ferfetz

Key observations:
- Plurals are formed by adding -s
- If the singular ends in a consonant, an epenthetic vowel is added before -s
  - -et → -etz
  - -at → -atz
  - -au → -aus
- Vowel changes may occur in the stem (e.g. bal - bals)

Problem 5 - Lalana Chinantec 

a. li:ʔ means 'beautiful'
b. ro:h means 'ripe'

c. Translations into Lalana Chinantec:
1) kalaʤö mo:h ne kwa:
2) li:ʔ kalaro:h kwɨ: kya ne 

d. Translations into English:  
1) The ripe corn turned out well
2) The beautiful corn grew

Key observations:
- Adjectives precede nouns
- li:ʔ 'beautiful' and ro:h 'ripe' are adjectives based on their position
- ne indicates 'well' and kya indicates 'beautifully' based on the translations
- Possessive 'my' is indicated by kya after the noun

Problem 6 - Molistic

a. You would likely hear:
b) The singer was not only molistic but also cluvious. 

Molistic and cluvious seem to be positive qualities that can describe people.

b. Qualities to look for in a person:
a) blitty
c) sloshful

Blitty and sloshful have positive connotations based on the examples. Weasy and frumsy seem to be more negative qualities.

The made-up words make it challenging to determine meaning with certainty, but the examples provide clues about positive vs. negative connotations and which words are used to describe people.

Problem 7 - Persian

a. Translations into English:
1) The stool under the table
2) The book under the bookcase

b. Translations into Persian:  
1) sang zir-e āb
2) ğābeğ zir-e deraxt

Key observations:
- zir-e is used for 'under' when the object is touching/supported by the landmark 
- pāin-e is used for a more general 'under/below' relation
- The preposition follows the landmark noun

Problem 8 - Kazakh

a. Matching and fill-in-the-blanks:
a-ii.  one and five - bir men bes  
b-iii. one and eight - bir men segiz
c-viii. three and two - üš pen eki
d-vii. four and seven - tört pen žeti
e-v. seven and fifty - žeti men elüw
f-i. eight and fifty - segiz ben elüw 
g-ix. thirteen and thirty - on üš pen otız
h-vi. thirty and two - otız ben eki
i-iv. fifty-two and ten - elüw eki men on

b. Translations into Kazakh:
1. bes pen otız segiz  
2. on men tört
3. žeti men elüw üš
4. otız segiz ben bes

Key observations:
- Numbers 1-10 have unique words
- Decades (20, 30, etc.) have unique words 
- Other numbers are formed by combining the decade and unit words
- 'and' is men with single digit numbers, ben with decades
- The order is smaller number + 'and' + larger number

Problem 9 - Japanese Chess

a. Filled in names:

Initial value	        Promoted value
1. hashiryū "Running Stag"	⟹ honroku hashiryū
2. ugun "Right Army"	    ⟹ tōshō "Sword General"

15. sagun "Left Army"	    ⟹ sagun "Left Army"
16. usha "Right Chariot"	⟹ utessha "Right Iron Chariot"
17. rōhei "Wolf Soldier"	⟹ honrō "Dashing Wolf"

Problem 12 - Basque Numbers

a. Filled in gaps:
lau × bost = hogei
lau × hamar = berrogei

b. In figures:  
(1) laurogeita hamahiru = 93
(2) hirurogei = 60

c. In Basque:
(1) 39 = hogeita hemeretzi  
(2) 77 = hirurogeita hamazazpi
(3) 80 = laurogei

Key observations:
- Numbers 1-10 have unique words
- Decades are formed by multiplying the unit and ten (hogei = 2 × 10, hirurogei = 3 × 20)  
- In between numbers use the decade plus the unit (hogeita bat = 20 + 1)
- Higher numbers string together decades and units (laurogeita hamahiru = 4 × 20 + 13)

Problem 14 - Icelandic Kinship

a. The older descendant of an immigrant is Ingimundur Sigurðarson Bergmann.

b. Kristín Guðrúnardóttir Aronsdóttir has no grandsons/granddaughters at the party.

- Guðmundur Kvaran Christiansson

g. Two possibilities for Steinunn's daughter with Björn Annasson:
- Guðrún Steinunnardóttir Björnsdóttir
- Guðrún Björnsdóttir Steinunnardóttir

Key observations:
- Patronymic naming system - father's first name + son/dóttir
- Some people have matronymic names from their mother
- Wives do not take husband's surname
- Surnames can be passed down as additional "middle names"  
- In a patronymic, the genitive case of the father's name is used

Problem 16 - Guaraní Verbs
