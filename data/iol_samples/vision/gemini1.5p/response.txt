**Problem 1: Georgian Countries**

a. The untranslated countries are **Argentina** and **Chile**.

**Problem 4: Japanese Braille**

a.  The key insight is that the Braille characters are based on hiragana, with a consistent shift. If you arrange the Roman letters of the given words in alphabetical order, you can deduce which Braille character corresponds to which hiragana and match the words:

* **atari:**  f.
* **haiku:** h.
* **katana:** a.
* **kimono:** b.
* **koi:** e.
* **sake:** c.


b.  Using the same shift pattern:

* g. **sushi**
* d. **tempura**

c. 

* **samurai:**  The Braille characters would be the same as for "kimono," but with an additional character for "sa" at the beginning.
* **miso:** The Braille characters would be the same as for "koi," but with "mi" replacing "ko" at the beginning, and an additional character for "so" at the end.

**Problem 11: Inuktitut Numerals**

**Problem 13: Basque Kinship**

a. 

* Top left: **Felix**
* Top middle: **Ines**
* Top right: **Miren**
* Bottom left: **Kontxi**
* Bottom middle: **Andres**


b. Kontxi is **female**. The problem states "Monika Kontxiren ahizpa da," which translates to "Monika is Kontxi's sister."  Sisters are female.


c.

1. Kontxi **Monikaren** ahizpa da. (Kontxi is Monika's sister.)
2. Inma eta Manu Iboneren **seme-alabak** dira. (Inma and Manu are Ibone's children.)
3. Ibone Andresen **arreba** da. (Ibone is Andres's sister.)
4. Manu Inmaren **anaia** da. (Manu is Inma's brother.)
5. Kontxi Mikelen **emaztea** da. (Kontxi is Mikel's wife.)
6. Emilio **Mirenen** senarra da. (Emilio is Miren's husband.)


**Problem 15: Manam**

a.

* **A:** Tola
* **B:**  Pita
* **C:** Sala
* **D:** Onkau
* **E:** Sulung


b.  You need to establish the meaning of the directional words based on the given locations.  Without further information about the Manam language, this part can't be definitively solved. Please provide a glossary of terms or more examples.

**Problem 17: Aymara**

a.  First, you need to understand the number and size words:

* *Mä*: one
* *Paya*: two
* *Kimsa*: three
* *challwa*: fish
* *hach'a*: big

Then, analyze the sentences:

1. "One big fish": **b**
2. "Three big fish": **e**
3. "One fish with one big fish": **f**
4. "One big fish with three fish": **c**
5. "Two fish": **d**
6. "One fish with two fish": **a**
7. "Three fish with two fish": **g**

Fisherman **g** is lying, as they claim to have caught five fish total, but the image shows only four.

b. The image shows one large fish and two small fish. The Aymara sentence would be: "Mä hach'a challwa paya challwallampiwa." (One big fish with two fish.)
