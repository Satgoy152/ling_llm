To solve this problem, let’s first approach the identification of Blissymbols and their English translations from the provided symbols and words.

Step 1: Recognize Patterns and Common Symbols

Blissymbolics often combines basic symbols to create complex meanings. Some basic shapes and lines could represent concepts such as human, action, or state, and are often combined or modified to create a specific word or phrase.

Step 2: Match Symbols with Words

Looking at the two image files of Blissymbols you uploaded (which I can visualize but not directly interact with), we would ideally recognize and assign symbols to the English words by the symbols’ components and their likely meanings. Here’s a general approach based on common symbols in Blissymbolics:

	1.	Circle or oval shapes often represent something abstract or a state of being.
	2.	Straight lines could indicate direction or a modifier for action.
	3.	Squiggly lines may imply something active or in motion.
	4.	Arrows could depict direction or action.
	5.	Figures with faces or partial faces could represent human-related actions or states.

Step 3: Example Matching

Unfortunately, without being able to directly view the symbols in real time, I cannot give a specific correspondence. However, here’s a theoretical approach:

	•	Waist might be represented by a symbol that focuses on the middle part of a basic human shape.
	•	Active and activity might involve squiggly lines or multiple arrows indicating movement.
	•	Ill, sick might use a human figure with an added symbol like a downward line or cross to indicate negativity.
	•	Lips could be a simple representation of a mouth shape.
	•	To blow and to breathe might include symbols like circles or arrows to indicate air movement.
	•	Western and east could use arrows pointing in respective directions.
	•	Merry might be a smiling face or a face with an upturned arrow.
	•	To weep could involve a face with downward lines or droplets.
	•	Saliva might involve a mouth with a droplet.

Step 4: Translation for Image 3B

Given the two images might use subsets of these symbols, it’s possible that duplicates represent either “to blow” or “to breathe,” based on their context with air or motion.

Step 5: Writing in Blissymbolics

For writing words like “air,” “body (torso),” “to rise,” “east,” and “sad”:

	•	Air might use a simple circle or spiral to indicate something intangible.
	•	Body (torso) could use a central section of a human figure.
	•	To rise might employ an upward arrow.
	•	East would use an arrow pointing right.
	•	Sad might be a face with a downward line or arrow.

Unfortunately, without specific images of the Blissymbols, these descriptions are based on typical uses and symbolic representation in Blissymbolics, and I would need to see each symbol to provide a direct translation.
