Let's approach this problem step-by-step:

(a) Determining the correct correspondences:

1. oL - western (looks like the sun setting in the west)
2. ~o - lips (resembles curved lips)
3. © - active (circle with an arrow, suggesting movement)
4. ^^v - to breathe (looks like lungs or air movement)
5. >□< - waist (resembles a narrowing in the middle)
6. o→ - activity (similar to "active" but with a direction)
7. ^v - to blow (air moving up and down)
8. o^x - ill, sick (person with head down)
9. o↓ - to weep (droplet falling from an eye)
10. ^ - merry (upward arrow suggesting positive mood)
11. ♡↑ - saliva (heart shape for mouth, arrow up for liquid)

(b) Interpreting the new symbols:

1. / - This likely means "east" (opposite of the "western" symbol)
2. ~ - This is the same as the "lips" symbol we identified earlier
3. ⊕ - This resembles a stylized apple, so it likely means "apple"
4. ^^ - This could mean "lungs" or "chest", as it's similar to the "breathe" symbol but without the downward arrow
5. >o - This could mean "mouth" or "to speak", as it's similar to the "lips" symbol but with an opening

The symbols for "~" (lips) and "^^" (possibly lungs/chest) have the same meaning in the context of the mouth/breathing area.

(c) Writing in Blissymbolics:

1. air: ^^v (using the "breathe" symbol, as air is what we breathe)
2. body (torso): >□< (using the "waist" symbol to represent the torso)
3. to rise: ↑ (an upward arrow to indicate rising)
4. east: / (as we identified in part b)
5. sad: v (the opposite of the "merry" symbol, pointing downward for negative mood)

This solution interprets the symbols based on their visual characteristics and the given translations, making logical connections between the symbols and their meanings.
