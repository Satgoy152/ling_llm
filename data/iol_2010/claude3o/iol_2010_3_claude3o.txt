Here is my solution to the Blissymbolics problem:
(a) The correct correspondences between the Blissymbols and their English translations are:
^ - active
^^ - activity
( - to blow
^ - western
:) - merry
:'( - to weep
âˆ¨ - saliva
âˆ¨âˆ¨ - to breathe
O - waist
â™¥ - ill, sick
ðŸ‘„ - lips
(b) The meanings of the given Blissymbols are:
âˆ  - east (opposite of west ^)
~ - air (wiggly lines like wind/breath)
âŒ‚ - to rise (arrow pointing up)
âˆ§ - sad (upside down smile)
âŠ™ - body/torso (circle shape like a torso)
âŠ¥ - body/torso (same as âŠ™)
(c) The Blissymbolics representations are:
air - ~
body (torso) - âŠ™ or âŠ¥
to rise - âŒ‚
east - âˆ 
sad - âˆ§
The key insights are:

Symbols can be combined to modify meaning (e.g. ^ active, ^^ activity)
Symbols have visual resemblance to their meaning (e.g. âˆ¨ saliva dripping, :'( weeping face)
Opposites use inverted symbols (e.g. ^ west, âˆ  east)
