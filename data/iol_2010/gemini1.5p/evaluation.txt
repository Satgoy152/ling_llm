    Part c:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The difference in plural formation for 'flowers' and 'parents' in Sursilvan (flurs, geniturs) compared to Engadine (fluors, genituors) showcases a dialectal variation. While both dialects use -s for pluralization, Engadine sometimes retains an -o- before the -s, potentially reflecting a more conservative form.
            Real Answer: In Sursilvan (unlike Engadine), the first rule doesn't apply in plural forms. This may mean that it doesn't work if one consonant is part of the stem and the other belongs to the ending, or that the vowel is chosen before the ending is added, or that the vowel in the plural is made to match the vowel in the singular.
