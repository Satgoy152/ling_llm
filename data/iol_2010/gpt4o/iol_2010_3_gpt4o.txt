I have opened the images you provided for detailed analysis. Now I will compare the Blissymbolics from both images and match them with the words provided.

(a) Determining the correct correspondences (Image 3A):

	1.	Waist: This symbol likely involves something indicating a body part, possibly a curved line or shape.
	2.	Active: Symbols that might contain dynamic elements such as arrows or movement markers.
	3.	Ill, sick: Often includes symbols for bodily harm or imbalance.
	4.	Lips: A curved or oval shape resembling the outline of lips.
	5.	Activity: Similar to “active,” but more focused on an event or process.
	6.	To blow: Could include air-related elements like circles with lines.
	7.	Western: Directional indicators, possibly arrows.
	8.	Merry: Symbols with upward movement or associated with joy.
	9.	To weep: Likely involves downwards motion or tears.
	10.	Saliva: Related to lips or mouth elements.
	11.	To breathe: Could include air or movement elements.

I will now work on matching these descriptions to specific Blissymbols based on their visual features.

(b) Indicating the meaning of symbols in Image 3B:

Next, I will infer the meanings of symbols in the second image by comparing them with those in the first image and their respective meanings.

(c) Writing new words in Blissymbolics:

For the terms “air,” “body (torso),” “to rise,” “east,” and “sad,” I will use the identified symbols as building blocks to create the appropriate combinations for these meanings.

I’ll provide the matches and symbols shortly.

(a) Correspondences between the Blissymbols in Image 3A and the given English words:

	1.	◯⟊: This symbol likely represents lips, as the shape resembles a mouth.
	2.	**~ ○**: This symbol seems to represent to blow, with the wavy line indicating air or movement and the circle representing a target or mouth.
	3.	⌁: This symbol may represent ill, sick, as it could be interpreted as a symbol showing imbalance or distress.
	4.	⌇: This is likely activity, since it resembles a more complex, connected structure, indicating ongoing action.
	5.	⌁↘: This could represent to weep, with the downward arrow signifying tears or a downward motion.
	6.	⌂ > ⌂: This symbol probably refers to western, as it could represent a directional movement or position.
	7.	v⌇: This symbol might be waist, with the triangular shape and horizontal element resembling the middle section of the body.
	8.	v⟊: This is likely merry, with the upward movement and open structure possibly indicating happiness.
	9.	◯↙: This symbol seems to represent saliva, as it contains a circle (likely representing the mouth) and a downward arrow (suggesting liquid or saliva).
	10.	⟃͠○: This symbol could be to breathe, as it suggests a flowing motion (indicating air) and the circle might symbolize an inhalation or exhalation.

(b) Meanings of symbols in Image 3B:

	1.	⟃: This symbol, which appears directional, likely represents east, a common symbol in directional languages.
	2.	~: This wavy line is often used for air, as it represents a flowing or invisible force.
	3.	⌂: This symbol might refer to body (torso), as it resembles a container or the central part of something.
	4.	⌇: This structure could mean to rise, as it contains upward elements or shapes indicating movement.
	5.	↘: This arrow might indicate sad, due to the downward motion symbolizing negative emotions.

(c) Writing new words in Blissymbolics:

	1.	Air: Use a wavy line (similar to ~).
	2.	Body (torso): Use a structure like ⌂.
	3.	To rise: Use an upward arrow or an upward motion indicator like ↑ or a combination of rising elements.
	4.	East: Use a directional symbol like ⟃.
	5.	Sad: Combine a downward arrow ↘ with other elements suggesting negativity.

This analysis should help you understand the correspondences and construct new Blissymbols. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments or clarifications! ￼
