Here are the solutions to the problems:

Problem 1:
Assignment 1 translations:
1. Aje ikuru kêt - You are not devouring me
2. Ba m! aku - I am devouring you guys  
3. Irêrê kêt - He/she is not swimming

Assignment 2 translations:
1. M! aj" ikuru kêt 
2. Ba m! anhê kêt
3. Ba to 
4. Ba aku

The key observations are:
- The subject pronouns are: ba (I), ga (you singular), m! (you plural), ij" (he/she/it)
- The object pronouns are: i- (me), m! a- (you guys), aj" (he/she/it) 
- Verbs: -to (dance), -rê (swim), -nhê (decorate), -kuru (devour)
- Negation is indicated by kêt at the end of the sentence

Problem 2:
The titles that did not match the translated articles are:
3. Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak. 
   Correct: Unsanitary Conditions in Brobdingnag Threaten Cholera Outbreak.
6. Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform.
   Correct: Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens to Derail Tax Reform. 
9. Unexpected Event in Country of Houyhnhnms Threatens Early Elections.
   Correct: Unexpected Event in Country of Houyhnhnms Threatens to Trigger Early Elections.

The errors are due to incorrect translation of the verb "threaten" which implies a potential negative future outcome. The correct translations use "threaten to" or "threatens to" to indicate this.

Problem 3: 
Assignment 1: 
The word that never contained the 'dh' sound is "fingo". 
Explanation: In the cognate words, 'dh' became 'd' in English. There are no English words starting with 'f' that correspond to the 'f' words in Latin, suggesting 'f' words never had 'dh'.

Assignment 2:
The words "brevis", "frigus", and "unda" likely never contained 'dh'. 
Explanation: These words start with 'b', 'f' and vowels respectively. As established in assignment 1, Latin 'f' words likely never had 'dh'. 'b' and vowel-initial words also seem unlikely to have had 'dh' historically based on the data.

Problem 4:
Assignment 1:
k'e*) - it sparks
k'ez) - it is fractured
phešniža - the surface is in a scratched condition 
suza - it has a slight bruise
xu*a - the surface is in a scraped condition

Assignment 2:
1. šli
2. nu*a  
3. *i 
4. g"l"za
5. žata

Assignment 3: 
ži likely means "it is orange". 
Explanation: zi means "it is yellow" and *i means "it is brown". Orange is between yellow and brown on the color spectrum, so ži, containing elements of both words, likely means "it is orange".

Problem 5:
Filled in Gaps:
? (row 4) - aptrat
.ühen - to be rinsed  
hup,n - to be closed
? (row 10) - çiter
? (row 18) - kaçar
sh,n - to freeze
ük - to fall
? (row 41) - k-r

Explanations:
- Verbs ending in t are transitive (do to something else), those without are intransitive/reflexive (done to self)
- Verbs ending in n are passive voice
- The vowels a/,/- seem to indicate different verb aspects, likely related to completion or duration of action
- ük / üker and k-r / k-rt seem to be irregular verb pairs based on their distinct patterns compared to the other verbs
