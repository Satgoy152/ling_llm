Problem 3:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The Latin word that never contained the dh sound is verbum (word). This is because "word" in English comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *wer-, which would not have had a dh sound in Latin.
            Real Answer: fumo (smoke). In Latin, the transition of the "dh" sound typically involved changes like "dh" -> "f". This word did not undergo this transition.
            Grade: 0
    Part b:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The Latin words that are sure to have never contained the dh sound are: fumus (smoke), mandere (to chew), vidua (widow). The other words likely contained the dh sound due to their etymological roots.
            Real Answer: brevis (short), unda (wave), deb (I owe). The sound "dh" did not influence the etymological development of these words.
