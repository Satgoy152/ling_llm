Problem 2:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: 3. Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak.
6. Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform.
9. Unexpected Event in Country of Houyhnhnms Threatens Early Elections.

Explanation:
These titles contain fictional place names from Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's Travels" (Brobdingnag, Lilliput, Country of Houyhnhnms). A translator working quickly might not recognize these as fictional and translate them literally, resulting in nonsensical headlines in the target language.
            Real Answer: 1. Title 4: New Crisis in Blefuscu Threatens Collapse of Peace Talks
   Correct Translation: "New crisis in Blefuscu threatens to destroy peace talks."

2. Title 8: Suspension of Talks Threatens Peace Process in Lilliput and Blefuscu
   Correct Translation: "Suspension of talks threatens to interrupt the peace process between Lilliput and Blefuscu."

3. Title 11: Global Cooling Threatens Food Shortages
   Correct Translation: "Unexpected climate cooling might lead to food shortages."

Explanation: The titles did not correspond to the content because the actual articles dealt with different scenarios. Knowledge of English was not necessary to identify this discrepancy, as it could be inferred by comparing the expected format of headlines with the articles provided.

Problem 3:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The word that never contained the dh sound is likely "falx" (sickle).

Explanation:
In the cognate English words, we can see that 'dh' became 'd' in medial positions (beard, widow) and initial 'w' (word). In "red", it became 'r'. Looking at the Latin words, we can see this pattern in "barba", "vidua", "verbum", and "rubrica". "falx" doesn't fit this pattern and likely never had a 'dh' sound.
            Real Answer: Answer: "fumo" (smoke)
   Explanation: In Latin, the transition of the "dh" sound typically involved changes like "dh" -> "f". This word did not undergo this transition.
            Grade: 0
    Part b:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: Words that likely never contained the dh sound:

- brevis (short)
- frigus (cold)
- unda (wave)

Explanation:
These words don't show the typical sound changes associated with original 'dh'. The others could potentially have contained 'dh' that changed to 'd' or 'b'.
            Real Answer: Answer:
   - brevis ("short")
   - unda ("wave")
   - deb ("I owe")
   
   Explanation: The sound "dh" did not influence the etymological development of these words.
