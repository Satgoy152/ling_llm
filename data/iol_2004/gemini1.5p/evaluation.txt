Problem 2:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The titles mentioning Lilliput, Blefuscu, and the Country of Houyhnhnms are problematic if the agency doesn't typically translate fictional material. The translator needs to verify and replace fictional place names with real-world locations.
            Real Answer: Title 4, 8, and 11 did not correspond to their content. This discrepancy could be identified without knowledge of English by comparing the expected format of headlines with the provided articles.
            Grade: 1

Problem 3:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The Latin word that never contained the dh sound is rubrica (red paint). The English cognate "red" has an 'r' sound, indicating a different sound change occurred, and the Latin word likely never had the dh sound.
            Real Answer: The word that never contained the "dh" sound is "fumo" (smoke). In Latin, the transition of the "dh" sound typically involved changes like "dh" -> "f". This word did not undergo this transition.
            Grade: 0
    Part b:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The Latin words brevis (short) and frigus (cold) are sure to have never contained the dh sound. These words contain the sounds 'b' and 'f'. The sound change from dh to 'b' or 'f' is unlikely in the development of Latin.
            Real Answer: The words that never contained "dh" sound are brevis ("short"), unda ("wave"), and deb ("I owe"). The sound "dh" did not influence the etymological development of these words.

            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The meaning of the word ži is likely "it is orange" or "it is a shade between yellow and red." This deduction is made by observing the meanings of "zi" (yellow) and "*i" (brown) and assuming a semantic pattern.
