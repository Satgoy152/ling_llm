## Problem 1: Birom Numerals

Unfortunately, without more information about Birom numerals and their system, it's impossible to provide a precise numerical translation. The problem assumes we already know the Birom numerical system, which isn't provided. 

To solve this, we would need information like:

* **Number Base:** Does Birom use a base-10 system like English, or a different base?
* **Number Words:** What are the Birom words for "one," "two," "three," and so on? 
* **Operations:** How are addition, multiplication, and exponentiation represented in Birom?

**Example:**  If we knew that "tùŋūn" means "one," "tàt" means "two," and "nààs" means "three," we could start translating the equations. However, without that knowledge, any attempt at a solution would be pure speculation.

**(b) Translating Abui to English:**

1. **amin:**  We cannot translate this word, as the provided vocabulary and examples don't offer enough information. We need more context or related examples.

2. **deya hebataa:**  "your (sg.) mother's hand" (using the pattern from "bataa hawata").

1. **pig:**  We need more information to form this word. Abui likely has a separate word for "pig," but it's not deducible from the given data.

3. **your (sg.) mother’s father:** mamaa hetama (assuming "mamaa" refers to a parent generally)

4. **my father’s face:**  tama heritama (assuming "tama" is a general word for "father")

5. **one’s own ear:**  rièng he...? (We need the word for "ear," which is not provided).

## Problem 5: Madak Word Deconstruction

**(a) Literal translation of "lavatbungmenemen":**

* **lavat-:**  prefix indicating "the whole" or "all-encompassing"
* **bung-:** likely related to "place" or "location" based on "levengkot" (places)
* **menemen:**  root word meaning "village" or "community," as seen in "levenmenemen" (villages)

Therefore, a literal translation of "lavatbungmenemen" is "the whole place of villages," which figuratively translates to "the whole world."

1.  **laradi:** two men (following the "lu-" prefix for two)

7.  **luvaroos:** two vines 

**(c) Translating English to Madak:**

8.  **heart:**  lempeve (singular of "levempeve")
9.  **gardens:** We need more information; we only have "loxontaamang" (part of a garden).
10.  **many things:**  laxavanga  ("laxa-" prefix for many)
11.  **grandchildren:**  larubuno (assuming "la-" prefix for plural)
12.  **two parts of day (two moments):**  lualeng  ("lu-" prefix for two, "aleng" for parts of day)
13.  **branches:**  We need more information; no direct translation is available.
14.  **big branches:**  We need the word for "branch" first.
