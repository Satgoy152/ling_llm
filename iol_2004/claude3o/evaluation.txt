            Grade: 1

Problem 2:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The titles that did not match the translated articles are: 3. Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak. 6. Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform. 9. Unexpected Event in Country of Houyhnhnms Threatens Early Elections. The errors are due to incorrect translation of the verb "threaten" which implies a potential negative future outcome. The correct translations use "threaten to" or "threatens to" to indicate this.
            Real Answer: Title 4: New Crisis in Blefuscu Threatens Collapse of Peace Talks, Title 8: Suspension of Talks Threatens Peace Process in Lilliput and Blefuscu, Title 11: Global Cooling Threatens Food Shortages. Explanation: The titles did not correspond to the content because the actual articles dealt with different scenarios. Knowledge of English was not necessary to identify this discrepancy, as it could be inferred by comparing the expected format of headlines with the articles provided.
            Grade: 0

Problem 3:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The word that never contained the 'dh' sound is "fingo". Explanation: In the cognate words, 'dh' became 'd' in English. There are no English words starting with 'f' that correspond to the 'f' words in Latin, suggesting 'f' words never had 'dh'.
            Real Answer: Answer: "fumo" (smoke). Explanation: In Latin, the transition of the "dh" sound typically involved changes like "dh" -> "f". This word did not undergo this transition.
            Grade: 1
    Part b:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The words "brevis", "frigus", and "unda" likely never contained 'dh'. Explanation: These words start with 'b', 'f' and vowels respectively. As established in assignment 1, Latin 'f' words likely never had 'dh'. 'b' and vowel-initial words also seem unlikely to have had 'dh' historically based on the data.
            Real Answer: Answer: brevis ("short"), unda ("wave"), deb ("I owe"). Explanation: The sound "dh" did not influence the etymological development of these words.
