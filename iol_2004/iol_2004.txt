### Problem 2 (10 points)
A translator at the Swift News agency, which regularly receives lots of material in English, tries to work as fast and efficiently as possible, and therefore first translates titles of articles and only then some of the articles. Because of this technique, however, some of the titles do not correspond to the contents of the translated articles and have to be reconsidered. This happened to three of the articles whose titles are given below.

1. Budget Cut Threatens Railway Modernization Project Funding.
2. Cold Winter Threatens Start of Shipping Season in Small Lakes.
3. Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak.
4. New Crisis in Blefuscu Threatens Collapse of Peace Talks.
5. Password Leak From Megasoft Threatens Mass Piracy.
6. Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform.
7. Sudden Weather Change Threatens Arrival of Reinforcements to Besieged City.
8. Suspension of Talks Threatens Peace Process in Lilliput and Blefuscu.
9. Unexpected Event in Country of Houyhnhnms Threatens Early Elections.
10. Terrorist Activity Threatens Public Security.
11. Global Cooling Threatens Food Shortages.

Assignment. Indicate which titles did not correspond to the contents of the articles after translations. Give the appropriate translations. Explain your solution.

Titles that did not correspond to the contents of the articles:
1. Cold Winter Threatens Start of Shipping Season in Small Lakes.
   - Correct translation: Sudden Weather Change Threatens Arrival of Reinforcements to Besieged City.

2. Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak.
   - Correct translation: Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform.

3. Password Leak From Megasoft Threatens Mass Piracy.
   - Correct translation: New Crisis in Blefuscu Threatens Collapse of Peace Talks.

Explanation:
The translator likely confused the titles due to the similar structure and overlapping vocabulary in the original and translated titles.

Consider the four English words cognate to four of the Latin words given above:
- beard
- word
- widow

Assignment 1. Indicate the Latin word of the above list that never contained the dh sound. Explain your solution.

- Latin word: rubrica
- Explanation: The word "red" comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *h₁rewdʰ-. The Latin "rubrica" has undergone a change, but it did not contain the dh sound originally.

Assignment 2. Consider six more Latin words:

| Latin Word     | English Translation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| brevis         | short               |
| gurdus         | silly               |
| frigus         | cold                |
| unda           | wave                |
| combrutum      | reed                |
| debeo          | I owe               |

Which of these words are sure to have never contained the dh sound? Why?

- Words: gurdus, unda, debeo
- Explanation: These words are sure to have never contained the dh sound because they derive from different Proto-Indo-European roots that did not include the dh sound.
