### Problem 2

The titles that did not correspond to the contents of the articles after translations are:

- **1. Budget Cut Threatens Railway Modernization Project Funding**: The contents likely discuss a specific budget cut, but not necessarily the railway modernization project funding. A more appropriate title might be "Budget Cuts Affect Transportation Projects".
  
- **3. Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak**: The article may not specifically discuss cholera; a more accurate title might be "Poor Sanitation Conditions in Brobdingnag Raise Health Concerns".

- **11. Global Cooling Threatens Food Shortages**: If the article discusses food security in general, a better title could be "Climate Change Impacts on Agriculture".

### Problem 3

#### Assignment 1
The Latin word that never contained the dh sound is **verbum** (word). This is because "word" in English comes from the Proto-Indo-European root *wer-, which would not have had a dh sound in Latin.

#### Assignment 2
The Latin words that are sure to have never contained the dh sound are:

- **fumus** (smoke) - this word does not contain any sounds that would relate to dh.
- **mandere** (to chew) - similar to fumus, there is no relation to the dh sound.
- **vidua** (widow) - this is also unrelated to the dh sound.

The other words likely contained the dh sound due to their etymological roots.

### Problem 5

The filled gaps based on logical deductions:

1. **?**: amant (to torment).
2. **?**: (to lead) could be **yuk**, as it fits with the pattern of other verbs.
3. **.ühen**: possibly **to rinse** (from .ühe).
4. **hup,n**: likely could mean **to be closed** (from a pattern).
5. **?**: to enter could be **tüç**, as it follows the pattern.

To summarize:
- I deduced based on existing patterns in the verbs and their translations, looking for common structures in the Chuvash language that would fit the gaps. However, some instances remain uncertain due to lack of data.
