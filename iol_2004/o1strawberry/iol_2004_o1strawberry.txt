Problem 2 Solution

Assignment: Identify the Incorrect Titles and Provide Correct Translations

Titles That Did Not Correspond to the Contents After Translation:

	1.	Title 3: Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Threatens Cholera Outbreak.
	2.	Title 6: Population Crisis in Lilliput Threatens Tax Reform.
	3.	Title 11: Global Cooling Threatens Food Shortages.

Explanation:

The confusion arises due to the ambiguous use of the word “threatens” in English. In these titles, “threatens” is intended to mean that the first noun may cause the second noun (i.e., cause leads to effect). However, the translator may have misinterpreted this, leading to incorrect translations where the cause and effect are reversed.

Correct Translations:

	1.	Title 3 Corrected:
	•	Correct Translation: Insanitariness in Brobdingnag Raises Risk of Cholera Outbreak.
	•	Explanation: Clarifies that insanitariness may lead to a cholera outbreak.
	2.	Title 6 Corrected:
	•	Correct Translation: Population Crisis in Lilliput Jeopardizes Tax Reform.
	•	Explanation: Indicates that the population crisis may hinder tax reform efforts.
	3.	Title 11 Corrected:
	•	Correct Translation: Global Cooling May Cause Food Shortages.
	•	Explanation: Specifies that global cooling could lead to shortages of food.

Explanation of the Solution:

	•	Ambiguity of “Threatens”: The word “threatens” can imply that either the subject is at risk or that the subject poses a risk to something else. This can lead to misinterpretation when translating, especially if the target language handles causality differently.
	•	Cause and Effect Reversal: In the mistranslations, the translator may have mistakenly reversed the cause and effect, leading to titles that did not match the content of the articles.
	•	Clarification in Translation: By rephrasing the titles to clearly indicate the cause and effect relationship, the translations align correctly with the articles’ contents.
