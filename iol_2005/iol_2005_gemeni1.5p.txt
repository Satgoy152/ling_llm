## Solutions to Computational Linguistics Problems

### Problem 1: Tzotzil

**Assignment 1: Translate into English**

16. **Ch’abal alekil ‘ixim.** - There is no good corn. 
17. **Mi ‘oy ‘ox vob ta k’in?** - Will there be music at the party? / Is there music at the party?
18. **K’usi ‘oy ‘ox ta Mexico lavie?** - What was in Mexico today? / What did you have in Mexico today? (The sentence could refer to an object or an experience)
19. **‘Oy ‘ox k’op ta batz’i k’op ta jna volje.** - There was a talk at the Tzotzil school yesterday.

**Assignment 2: Translate into Tzotzil**

20. Where is the party today?  - **Bu ‘oy ‘ox k’in lavie?**
21. There was nothing in the pot today. - **Ch’abal ‘ox k’usi ta p’in lavie.**
22. You have a real house. - **‘Oy ‘ox sbatz’i a na.**
23. Will Juana be in San Cristobal tomorrow?  - **Bu ‘oy ‘ox li Xunka ta Jobel ‘ok’ob?**
24. He will soon have no pot. - **Ch’abal ‘ox chenek’ ta p’in lavie.** (This translation uses "today" to convey "soon." A closer translation might require additional context or a Tzotzil expression for "soon" that wasn't provided.)

### Problem 2: Lango

**Assignment 1: Pair up the words with their correct translations.**

- **dyé ot** - eyeball
- **dyé tyén** - hat
- **gin** - roof
- **gin wic** - garment
- **fig** - floor
- **fig wég** - restaurant
- **ot cem** - sole of foot
- **wic ot** - grain

**Assignment 2: Translate into English:**

- **cém:** ground
- **dyé:**  eye

**Assignment 3: Translate into Lango:**

- window -  This translation requires more context or information about how Lango expresses specific objects. A literal translation of "eye of the house" might be inaccurate or nonsensical.

### Problem 3: Mansi

**Assignment 1: Determine the values of the following Mansi numerals:**

- **atsatn at** - (5 x 100) + (5 x 5) = 525
- **ńolsat nopsl xot** - (8 x 100) + (4 x 10) + (5) = 845
- **ontbllowsatn ontsllowxujplow** - (9 x 1000) + (9 x 100) + (8 x 10) + (15) = 9995 

**Assignment 2: Spell out the following numerals in Mansi:**

- 58 - **atlow nopsl nollow**
- 80 - **ńolsat**
- 716 - **ńolsatn xotlow nopsl atxujplow** 


### Problem 4: Yoruba

19. the witch’s city - **[ìlú ajé]** 
20. the house of love (venue of the creation of the first human beings in Yoruba mythology) - **[ilé ìfé]** (This is the same as phrase 11, but context implies a specific mythological location)
21. the husband’s axe - **[àkè oko]** 


### Problem 5: Lithuanian

**Assignment 1: Determine which accent paradigms originally belonged together.**

The accent paradigms that originally belonged together are:

* **Paradigm 1 and 3:**  Both show a pattern of the accent moving one syllable back from the Nominative Singular to the other forms.
* **Paradigm 2 and 4:** Both maintain the accent on the same syllable across all forms.

**Assignment 2: Determine what the initial accent paradigms looked like.**

Based on Saussure's Law (which will be formulated in the next assignment), we can reconstruct the original paradigms as follows:

**Original Paradigm 1 & 3**

| **Case**        | **Singular** | **Plural** |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Nominative** |  *lièpa*     |  *lièpos*    |
| **Genitive**   |  *liepòs*    |  *liepòs*    |
| **Accusative** |  *liepàs*    |  *liepàs*    |

**Original Paradigm 2 & 4**

| **Case**        | **Singular** | **Plural** |
|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Nominative** | *rankà*      |  *rankàs*    |
| **Genitive**   | *rankòs*     |  *rankàs*    |
| **Accusative** |  *rankàs*    |  *rankàs*    |

**Assignment 3: Formulate Saussure’s Law.**

Saussure's Law states that in Lithuanian, the accent shifted one syllable back from its original position in all forms **except** the Nominative Singular, **if** the original accent fell on the penultimate syllable and this syllable was of the "falling intonation" type.
