    Part c:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: Saussure's Law states that if a word's syllable of the first type was accented and the ending was of the second type, the accent moved to the ending. This created a new accent paradigm with the accent on the ending in the Genitive Singular and Nominative Plural, and on the root in the Accusative Plural. This explains the division into four paradigms from the original two.
            Real Answer: Saussure's Law states that if a word had a circumflex accent on its root in the singular, the accent would shift to the ending in the plural, creating the two subgroups of paradigms.
