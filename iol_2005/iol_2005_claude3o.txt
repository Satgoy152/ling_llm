Problem 5 (Lithuanian) 

Assignment 1: Paradigms 1 and 3 originally belonged together, as did Paradigms 2 and 4.

Assignment 2: The initial paradigms looked like:
Paradigm 1/3 (example: liepà)
Nom. Sg. lìepà  
Gen. Sg. lìepòs
Nom. Pl. lìepòs
Acc. Pl. lìepàs

Paradigm 2/4 (example: rankà)  
Nom. Sg. rankà
Gen. Sg. rankòs
Nom. Pl. rankòs 
Acc. Pl. rankàs

Assignment 3: Saussure's Law can be formulated as follows:
If a noun belonging to Paradigm 1/3 has a syllable of the second type (rising intonation) in the root, the accent shifts to the ending in forms other than the Nom. Sg. and Acc. Pl., yielding Paradigm 3.

This was a challenging but fun set of problems that tested knowledge of morphology, syntax, semantics and historical linguistics across several diverse language families. Let me know if you would like me to explain or elaborate on any part of the solutions!
