    Part b:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: Vowel Length and Quality: Long vowels in Faroese are transcribed with a colon (e.g., [ø:], [Oa:], [a:], etc.). The orthography provides clues to vowel quality and length. Consonant Transcription: Consonants such as "g" are often transcribed with [j] when they appear in certain environments. The ending consonants often reflect the orthographic representation. Glides and Transitions: The presence of glides like [j] and [w] is inferred from the combination of vowels and consonants in the orthographic form.
            Real Answer: 1. Vowels: a [Ea], á [Oa], e [e:], ei [ai], ey [Ei], i [i:], o [o:], oy [Oi], ó [Ou], u [u:], ú [0u], ø [ø:]. 2. Between vowels: ð = g 3. Rules for ð/g transformation: 1. [w] | [u(:)] 2. [j] | [i(:)] or [i(:)] 3. [v] | [u(:)] 4. [v] in a noun, [∅] in a verb.
