Now let’s address Problem 5 based on the provided information:

Part (a): Determine the barcode assignments and answers.

	1.	Toilet paper (Spain): Barcode E.
	2.	Smoked salmon (Ireland): Product code is 02661; the checksum digit needs to be calculated.
	3.	The Lost Symbol (ISBN book): The barcode corresponds to the ISBN system number 978.
	4.	Pork steak (packed in the store): Cost is 4 euros and 16 cents; we need to find the corresponding barcode.
	5.	Mop head (from where?): The full code is 4-023103-075702; we need to identify the barcode.
	6.	Cholesterol-lowering spread (Finland): The system number for Finland is 64; identify the barcode.
	7.	Sirloin steak (packed in the store): We need to find the corresponding barcode and its cost.
	8.	Korsordboken (puzzle magazine, Sweden): Full code needed.
	9.	Mots Codés (puzzle magazine, France): Identify the corresponding barcode.

Summary of known system numbers:

	•	20–29: in-store functions
	•	30–37: France
	•	40–44: Germany
	•	539: Ireland
	•	64: Finland
	•	73: Sweden
	•	84: Spain
	•	978: ISBN (books)
	•	??: Norway

Next Steps:

	•	Identifying the Barcodes: Review the barcodes from Img5C and the general assignment criteria to fill in the remaining information for each product.
	•	Checksum Calculation: Calculate the checksum for the smoked salmon barcode.

Let’s proceed with these calculations and assignments.  ￼
