### Problem 5: Barcode Structure
#### Rules:
1. Patterns of bars:
   - `•◦•` (at both ends)
   - `◦•◦•◦` (in the middle)
2. Each digit is shown as four bars of widths 1–4, with a total width of 7.
3. Three codes for each digit:
   - R (right)
   - A (left)
   - B (left)

#### Codes:
| Digit | A     | B     | R     |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0     | 3211  | 1123  | 3211  |
| 1     | 2221  | 1222  | 2221  |
| 2     | 2122  | 2212  | 2122  |
| 3     | 1411  | 1141  | 1411  |
| 4     | 1132  | 2311  | 1132  |
| 5     | 1231  | 1321  | 1231  |
| 6     | 1114  | 4111  | 1114  |
| 7     | 1312  | 2131  | 1312  |
| 8     | 1213  | 3121  | 1213  |
| 9     | 3112  | 2113  | 3112  |
| X     | ——    | ——    | ——    |

#### (a) Translations:
1. `(E);`
2. `G, checksum = 2;`
3. `C;`
4. `D;`
5. `A, Germany;`
6. `I;`
7. `H, cost = 4 euros and 74 cents;`
8. `B, full code = 7-317442-030049;`
9. `F.`

#### (b) —

#### (c) This barcode is upside down (it starts with a B, not with an A), so it must be turned over and written backwards.

- Norway = 70, full code = `7-022070-000035`.
