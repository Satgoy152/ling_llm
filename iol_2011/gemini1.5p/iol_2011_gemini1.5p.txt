## Problem 1 (Menominee)

**(a) Translations:**

- **kekēskahæq:**  we_{1+2} bite it through (This directly matches example 12)
- **nepāhkenan:** I open it by tool (by raising a lid or opening a door) (Similar to example 11, but with 1st person singular prefix "ne-") 
- **wǣpāhpew:** he begins to open up (Combination of example 17 "wǣpohnæw - he begins walking" and the root of example 19 "pāhkeqtaw - he opens up")

**(b) Translations:**

- I begin to eat it: **newǣp̄ıtam** (Combining "ne-" (I) + "wǣp" (begin) + "̄ıtam" (eat), assuming "-ıtam" is a plausible form based on "kep̄ıtahtæq")
- we_{1+2} lay it flat by hand: **ke...tæq**  (We need more information about the verb root for "lay it flat". The prefix "ke-" indicates 1st person plural inclusive, and "-tæq" is a common suffix.)
- he digs a hole:  **wǣpānæw** (Assuming "digging a hole" is a similar action to "begin to dig" as in example 8.)
- he walks out: **kātohnæw** (Taking the root "kātohnæ" from example 6 and adding the 3rd person singular suffix "-w") 

**Note:** These translations are based on limited data and some guesswork. More information about Menominee verb morphology would be needed for completely accurate translations.

## Problem 2 (Faroese)

**(a) Phonetic Transcriptions:**

| Word  | Phonetic Transcription | Translation            |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| bøga  | [bøːa]               | hen bird               |
| knoðar | [knøːar]              | (he) kneads            |
| kvøða | [kvøːa]               | (they) sing            |
| løgur | [løːvur]              | liquid                 |
| plága | [pláːa]              | nuisance, affliction   |
| skaði | [skáːi]              | damage, loss           |
| toygur | [tɔɪvur]             | swallow, gulp, draught |
| trúgi  | [trʉ́ːwi]              | may (he) endanger      |

**(b) Rules:**

1. **Vowel length:** In Faroese, a single vowel followed by a single consonant is usually long (e.g., "bøga" - [bøːa]). 
2. **Diphthongs:** The combination "oy" is pronounced as a diphthong [ɔɪ] (e.g., "toygur" - [tɔɪvur]).
3. **Consonant clusters:** The cluster "ð" before a consonant is often silent (e.g., "knoðar" - [knøːar]).
4. **Vowel quality:**  The vowels and their phonetic transcriptions are consistent with the provided examples, paying attention to distinctions like [ø] vs. [ɔ]. 


## Problem 3 (Vai)

**(a) Translations:**

- mùsúĚ á gbòmùĚ: **the woman’s fish**
- léN kúndúĚ á nỳımı̀̀ıĚ: **the child's short snake** 
- gbòmù-lÈndÈ kúndúĚ: **the small boat's eye**

**(b) Correction and Translation:**

- Error: "kándÒ-lÈndÉ lÒÒĚ"
- Correction: "kándÒ lÒÒĚ" (The possessive marker "lÈndÉ" is unnecessary because "kándÒ" (sky) is not possessed by another noun in this phrase)
- Translation: **the small sky**

**(c) Translations:**

- the eagle’s snake: **kÒánjàĚ á nỳımı̀̀ıĚ**
- the small child’s eye: **léN kúndúĚ já**
- the tall man’s sister: **kà́ıĚ jǎNĚ á mùı̀** (Assuming "mùı̀" means sister) 
- the small baby-snake: **kÒánjà-lèNĚ  kúndúĚ**

**(b) Translations:**

- possessor of water: **atlhuah** (combining "atl" - water, and "huah" - possessor/owner)
- revered man/husband: **oquichhuahtotoltzintli** (combining "oquichhuah" - man/husband, and "totoltzintli" - revered)

**(c) Translations:**

- cacahuatl: **cacao water** (assuming "cacahuatl" follows the same pattern as "chilatl")
- cacahuatetl: **cacao stone** (combining "cacahua" - cacao, and "tetl" - stone)
- cacahuaatl: **cacao water** (likely a variant spelling of "cacahuatl")
- cacahuahuah: **cacao owner** (combining "cacahua" - cacao, and "huah" - possessor/owner)
