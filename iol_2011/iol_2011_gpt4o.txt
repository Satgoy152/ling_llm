### Problem 1

#### (a) Translate into English:

1. **kekēskahæq**  
   - "we_{1+2} bite it through"  
   Based on the pattern observed, "kekēskahtæq" is translated as "we_{1+2} bite it through". The form "kekēskahæq" is likely a variant or error, but the core meaning seems to revolve around the action of biting through something by a group including the speaker and the listener.

2. **nepāhkenan**  
   - "I open it by tool (by raising a lid or opening a door)"  
   The verb form "pāhkaham" translates to "he opens it by tool", and "pāhkeqtaw" translates to "he opens up". The prefix "ne-" indicates the first person singular "I", so "nepāhkenan" should mean "I open it by tool".

3. **wǣpāhpew**  
   - "he begins walking"  
   The verb form "wǣpohnæw" translates to "he begins walking". The form "wǣpāhpew" appears to follow a similar pattern, indicating the action of beginning to walk.

#### (b) Translate into Menominee:

1. **I begin to eat it**  
   - "newǣpem"  
   Using the pattern from "wǣpohnæw" (he begins walking) and "kewǣpeqtaq" (we_{1+2} begin), "newǣpem" would indicate "I begin to eat it".

2. **we_{1+2} lay it flat by hand**  
   - "kewǣkenam"  
   Based on the pattern of verbs describing actions by hand, such as "kēskenam" (he breaks it through by hand), "kewǣkenam" would be consistent for "we_{1+2} lay it flat by hand".

3. **he digs a hole**  
   - "tawǣham"  
   Based on "tawǣsam" (he cuts a hole in it) and the action of digging, "tawǣham" would be a reasonable construction.

4. **he walks out**  
   - "kekǣtohnæw"  
   Following the pattern from "kekǣtohnæq" (we_{1+2} walk out), "kekǣtohnæw" would mean "he walks out".

### Problem 2

#### (a) Fill in the gaps:

1. **bøga**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [bø:ja]  
   The word "bøga" corresponds to "hen bird", and based on the spelling and sounds in Faroese, it likely uses the vowel [ø:] and ends with the glide [j].

2. **knoðar**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [knOa:ar]  
   The word "knoðar" corresponds to "(he) kneads", and the transcription must reflect the vowel [Oa:] and ending [ar].

3. **kvøða**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [kvø:va]  
   The word "kvøða" corresponds to "(they) sing", using the vowel [ø:] and ending with [va].

4. **løgur**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [lø:jur]  
   The word "løgur" corresponds to "liquid", with vowel [ø:] and ending [jur].

5. **plága**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [plOa:ja]  
   The word "plága" corresponds to "nuisance, affliction", using [Oa:] and ending with [ja].

6. **skaði**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [ska:ji]  
   The word "skaði" corresponds to "damage, loss", using [a:] and ending [ji].

7. **toygur**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [tOijur]  
   The word "toygur" corresponds to "swallow, gulp, draught", and the transcription must reflect the vowel [Oi] and ending [jur].

8. **trúgi**  
   - Phonetic Transcription: [tru:ji]  
   The word "trúgi" corresponds to "may (he) endanger", using [u:] and ending [ji].

#### (b) Describe the rules you used:

1. **Vowel Length and Quality**: Long vowels in Faroese are transcribed with a colon (e.g., [ø:], [Oa:], [a:], etc.). The orthography provides clues to vowel quality and length.

2. **Consonant Transcription**: Consonants such as "g" are often transcribed with [j] when they appear in certain environments. The ending consonants often reflect the orthographic representation.

3. **Glides and Transitions**: The presence of glides like [j] and [w] is inferred from the combination of vowels and consonants in the orthographic form.

### Problem 3

2. **léN kúndúĚ á nỳımı̀̀ıĚ**
