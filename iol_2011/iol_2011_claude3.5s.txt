I'd be happy to help solve this computational linguistics problem. Let's break it down step by step:

### Problem 1

(a) Translating into English:

- kekēskahæq - we_{1+2} break it through by tool
This is based on the pattern in sentence 4, with the prefix ke- indicating "we_{1+2}" and the ending -hæq suggesting "by tool".

- nepāhkenan - I open it by hand
This combines elements from sentences 5 (pāhk-) and 15 (-enam), with the ne- prefix for "I".

- wǣpāhpew - he begins laughing
This combines elements from sentences 17 (wǣp-) and 21 (-āhpe-), indicating "begin" and "laughing".

(b) Translating into Menominee:

- I begin to eat it - newǣpetam
- we_{1+2} lay it flat by hand - kekāwenam
- he digs a hole - tawǣsam
- he walks out - kǣtohnæw

These translations are based on patterns observed in the given sentences, combining appropriate prefixes, roots, and suffixes.

### Problem 2

(a) Filling in the gaps:

- bøga [bø:va]
- knoðar [kno:ar]
- kvøða [kvø:a]
- løgur [lø:vur]
- plága [plOava]
- skaði [skEaji]
- toygur [tOigur]
- trúgi [tru:ji]

(b) Rules:

1. ð is pronounced as [j] between vowels, and is silent at the end of a word.
2. g is pronounced as [v] between back vowels (a, o, u) and [j] between front vowels (e, i, y).
3. Long vowels are represented with a colon in the phonetic transcription.
4. ø is pronounced as [ø], ey as [Ei], oy as [Oi], ú as [u:].
5. Vowels before gi at the end of a word are lengthened.

### Problem 3

(a) Translating into English:

- mùsúĚ á gbòmùĚ - the woman's fish
- léN kúndúĚ á nỳımı̀̀ıĚ - the short eagle's snake
- gbòmù-lÈndÈ kúndúĚ - the short boat

(b) The correct phrase should be: kándÒ-lÈndÉĚ lÒÒ
Translation: the small sky-vessel

(c) Translating into Vai:

- the eagle's snake - léNĚ á nỳımı̀̀ıĚ
- the small child's eye - dı́ lÒÒĚ já
- the tall man's sister - kà́ı jǎNĚ lÒÒ-mùsú
- the small baby-snake - nỳımı̀̀ı-kÒánjà lÒÒĚ

### Problem 4

calhuah - master of house
