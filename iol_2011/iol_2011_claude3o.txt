Here are the solutions to the computational linguistics problems:

Problem 1 (Menominee)

(a) Translations into English:

kekēskahæq - we_{1+2} break it through by tool
nepāhkenan - I open it by hand (by raising a lid or opening a door)  
wǣpāhpew - he begins laughing

(b) Translations into Menominee:

I begin to eat it - newǣpāqtam
we_{1+2} lay it flat by hand - ketǣnæhkæq
he digs a hole - wǣpohnæw (or tawǣsam)
he walks out - kǣtohnæw

The key insights are:
- Preverbs indicate direction/location (e.g. p̄ıt- 'hither', kǣt- 'out')
- -æq, -æm endings indicate we_{1+2} vs I as subject 
- Final -am, -aq, -aw indicate the action is done by tool, by hand, or intransitively
- wǣp- indicates beginning an action
- Vowel changes in the verb stem indicate different meanings

Problem 2 (Faroese)

(a) Missing phonetic transcriptions:

bøga - [bø:a]
knoðar - [knOar] 
kvøða - [kvø:a]
løgur - [lø:vur]
plága - [plOava] 
skaði - [skEaji]
toygur - [tOivur]
trúgi - [tr0uwi]

(b) The key rules are:
- ð is pronounced as [j] between vowels, otherwise as [v]  
- g is [j] after front vowels and certain diphthongs, otherwise [w] or [v]
- á is always [Oa]
- ó is [Ou] 
- Accented vowels and vowels before single consonants are long
- úC and CúC have [0u]
- ýC has [0i]

Problem 3 (Vai)

(a) Translations into English:

mùsúĚ á gbòmùĚ - the woman's fish
léN kúndúĚ á nỳımı̀̀ıĚ - the short snake's tooth  
gbòmù-lÈndÈ kúndúĚ - the short boat

(b) Correction and translation:
kándÒ-lÈndÉ lÒÒĚ -> kándÒ-lÈndÈ lÒÒĚ - the sky's small boat

(c) Translations into Vai:

the eagle's snake - kÒánjàĚ á nỳımı̀̀ıĚ
the small child's eye - dèN kúndúĚ já  
the tall man's sister - kà́ı jǎNĚ lÒÒ-mùsú
the small baby-snake - dèN-nı̀mı̀ kúndúĚ

The key insights are:
- Genitive constructions use á between nouns
- Adjectives follow nouns directly 
- Compounds are head-final (e.g. baby-snake)
- jǎN is 'tall/long', kúndú is 'short', lÒÒ is 'small'

Problem 4 (Nahuatl) 

(a) Correct translations:

acalhuah - canoe owner
achilli - water pepper
atl - water
callah - house owner
calhuah - master of house 
chilatl - chili water
chilli - chili
colli - ancestor
coltzintli - revered ancestor
conehuah - master of child
conehuahcapil - child possessor of stones
conetl - child
oquichconetl - boy
