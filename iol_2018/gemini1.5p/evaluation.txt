    Part b:
        1:
            Classification: Type 2
            LLM Answer: These words are different from native Terena words because they don't follow the regular pattern of first-person and second-person singular forms. In native words, the second person form usually replaces the initial "n" sound with a "x" sound. However, in these borrowed words,  the second person form replaces the initial "l" sound with a "le" sound.
            Real Answer: In Portuguese loanwords, the vowel á is treated differently: it becomes eá in these loanwords, whereas in native words, á changes to é, and â changes to eâ.

Problem 4:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The word X is "atuh", which means "and". The linguist thought it was missing in these examples: Example 2: nybat biabys juhurubys (6 eggs) - It should be "nybat atuh biabys juhurubys". Example 8: wiwis biabys bøbys (14 betel nuts) - It should be "wiwis atuh biabys bøbys". Example 11: anowip biabys juhurubys (26 eggs) - It should be "anowip atuh biabys juhurubys". The word "atuh" is implied because the numbers 6, 14, and 26 are all formed by adding a set of 10 to the base numbers (6, 4, and 16 respectively).  The use of "atuh" isn't mandatory when expressing these compound numbers, as the context makes it clear that addition is being used.
            Real Answer: The word that the linguist initially thought was missing is "sugar canes," which are represented by the word arah. The three examples are: 1. 6 sugar canes — biogu nybat, 2. 10 sugar canes — biogu nybat atuh araruh, 3. 23 sugar canes — biogu atugu biogu biaruh atuh araruh. (6, 9, 11): 4 =nybat,8=biogu nybat,k×4(3≤k)=k-t/gunybat. In these examples, the term "sugar canes" is implied by context and number markers rather than being explicitly stated.
