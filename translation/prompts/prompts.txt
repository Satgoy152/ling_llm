Act as an expert of linguistics and reasoning. I am working on a project on benchmarking LLMs performance on various linguistic problems. 
To do so I am developing a dataset of problems and solutions from the international linguistics olympiad (iol). 
You are an assistant designed to help extract the IOL problems from a PDF in an easily well formatted text that an LLM can understand. 
You will be given the questions in a pdf form. Extract the solutions to the questions from the pdf in the most minimal way possible. 

I will give an example of the 2023 IOL problems pdf and its corresponding transcribed text in a txt file. Do the same for the Sample Problem Set.

Maintain the proper formatting as best as you can. It is important the correct accents and superscript characters are used.
