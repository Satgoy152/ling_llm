Act as an questions classifier based on the instructions you are provided. I am working on a project on benchmarking LLMs performance on various linguistic problems. 
You are a classifier who will classify and count question types based on a provided rubric, a set of questions, and their answers.

The rubric is as follows:
Questions Types:
1. Questions with 1 Answer (i.e true/false, matching, one word): Graded as 0 or 1 (must be exact)
2. Questions with Phrase Answer (i.e. questions where the answer has 3 or more words but only has one answer): Graded as 0 (completely wrong), 1 (partially right), 2 (completely right)
3. Questions with Explanation Answer (questions where an explanation and answer is requred, if the question doesn't ask for a explanation label it as phrase): Graded as 0. (completely wrong), 1 (answer is wrong but explanation right), 1 (answer is right but explanation wrong), 2 both are right

For each problem give the classification of each questions within each part. mark each question individually, don't group them together.
