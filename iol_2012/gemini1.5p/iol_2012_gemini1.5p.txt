## Problem 1: Dyirbal

**(a)** The animal is the **lizard**. The linguist probably found it strange that the lizard in sentence 15 was described as "**tired**" (biNgun), which might have seemed an unusual characteristic for a lizard. However, if lizards are associated with "old women" in Dyirbal mythology, this description might make more sense, as old age is often associated with tiredness.
