I understand. I'll grade the LLM's answers based on the provided rubric and classifications. Here's the grading:

Problem 1:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The animal regarded as "old women" in Dyirbal myths is the eel (waymin). The linguist likely thought balan waymin ("the mother-in-law") in sentence 3 was an error, expecting bayi waymin instead since waymin is an animate noun. But mythological associations can affect noun classes.
            Real Answer: The grasshopper is neither a woman nor a dangerous animal, but takes the same article, so it must be the "old woman" from the myth. The linguist thought that baNgun bundiñéu in example (14) was an error.
