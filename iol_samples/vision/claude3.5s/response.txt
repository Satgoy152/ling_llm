I'll analyze each problem and provide solutions:

Problem 1: Georgian Countries

a. The untranslated countries in Georgian are:

პერუ - Peru
ურუგვაი - Uruguay

This can be deduced by matching the Georgian script to the English translations provided for Brazil and comparing the patterns.

Problem 4: Japanese Braille

a. Matching the tenji words to their meanings:

atari - d
haiku - f
katana - c
kimono - e
koi - a
sake - b

b. The words in tenji are:

karate
sushi

c. Writing words in tenji:

a) samurai:
[I would need to create a tenji representation here, which I can't do in text form]

b) miso:
[I would need to create a tenji representation here, which I can't do in text form]

Problem 11: Inuktitut Numerals

Based on the image provided, we can deduce the following:

\ represents 1
V represents 2
- represents 5
W represents 10
ꜵ (the symbol that looks like a figure 8) represents 20

a. Answers in Inuktitut numerals:

V\ + V\ = W (2+2=4)
ꜵ x --- = WW- (20x3=60)
\ꜵ - V\ = \W (18-2=16)
- x - = V- (5x5=25)
W - V\ = W (12-2=10)
\V + \W = VV (12+10=22)
V ÷ V\ = \ (4÷2=2)

b. Today's date in Inuktitut numerals (assuming October 14, 2024):

Day: \W (14)
Month: \ꜵ (10)
Year: VꜵVW (2024)

Problem 13: Basque Kinship

a. The blank spaces should be filled as follows:
Left of Mikel: Ines
Right of Mikel: Felix
Left of Ibone: Andres
Right of Monika: Kontxi

b. Kontxi is female. This can be deduced from the sentence "Monika Kontxiren ahizpa da," where "ahizpa" means "sister" (for a female).

c. Filling in the gaps:

1. Kontxi Monikaren ahizpa da.
2. Inma eta Manu Iboneren seme-alabak dira.
3. Ibone Andresen arreba da.
4. Manu Inmaren neba da.
5. Kontxi Mikelen emaztea da.
6. Emilio Mirenen senarra da.

Problem 15: Manam

a. The houses belong to:
A: Sala
B: Tola

E: Butokang

b. Three sentences describing Arongo's house location:
1. Arongo pera kana ata ieno, Pita pera kana awa ieno.
2. Arongo pera kana auta ieno, Sulung pera kana ilau ieno.
3. Arongo pera kana ata auta ieno, Butokang pera kana awa ilau ieno.

Problem 17: Aymara

a. Matching fishermen to their catch:
1 - F (one big fish)
2 - G (three big fish)
3 - B (one small fish and one big fish)
4 - D (one big fish and three small fish)
5 - A (two small fish)
6 - C (one small fish and two big fish)
7 - E (This is the lie, as the image shows 4 small fish and 2 big fish)

b. Describing your catch in Aymara:
"Paya hach'a challwa kimsa challwallampiwa challwataxa."
(Two big fish with three small fish)
