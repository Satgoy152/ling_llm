Problem 4
Japanese Braille

Braille is a tactile writing system based on a series of raised dots that is widely used by the blind. 

To  the  right  is  a  Japanese  word  written  in  the tenji (“dot characters”) writing system. 
The large dots  represent  the  raised  bumps;  the  tiny  dots represent empty positions.

a. The following tenji words represent atari, haiku, katana, kimono, koi, and sake.
Which is which? You don’t need to know either Japanese or Braille to figure it out; you’ll find that the system is highly logical.

Problem 11

Inuktitut is one of the main languages of the Inuit people, which lives in several areas in the
northern Canada and Alaska. Few years ago, students from a school in the small town of Kaktovik
invented a new way of writing numbers, more appropriate for the way numbers are expressed in
the Inuktitut language.
Imagine that you are travelling through northern Canada and find some Inuit students that know
nothing about English, Latin script or Indo-Arabic numerals. Then, in order to start
communication, one of the students offer you a list of mathematical operations, shown below (in
the left column). This version of the table uses the Indo-Arabic symbols for the operations.

[Img 11A attatched]

a. Seeing that you understood the table, the student challenges you to write down the answers of
another series of operations, shown in the right column. Give the answers in Inuktitut numerals.

b. To assure the student that you understood the system, you decided to write down the date of
today (day, month and year) in Inuktitut numerals, assuming they used Gregorian calendar. What
did you write down?

Problem 13: Basque Kinship

This is the genealogical tree of a Basque family. The blanks spaces in the diagram stand for the names Ines, Kontxi, Felix, and Andres (listed here in no particular order).

[Img 13A attatched]

Some of the relationships between the members of this family are described below in Basque:

	•	Ines Mikelen emaztea da.
	•	Monika Kontxiren ahizpa da.
	•	Inma Manuren arreba da.
	•	Iker Joseparen senarra da.
	•	Mikel Felixen anaia da.
	•	Andres Iboneren neba da.
	•	Ibone eta Felix senar-emazteak dira.
	•	Andres eta Ibone Emilioren seme-alabak dira.
	•	Manu Iboneren semea da.

a. Identify the names that belong in the blank spaces in the diagram.
b. Is Kontxi male or female? Explain, using the data from the problem.
c. Fill in the gaps in the following Basque sentences (referring to the same family):
	•	(1) Kontxi ___________________ ahizpa da.
	•	(2) Inma eta Manu Iboneren ___________________ ________.
	•	(3) Ibone Andresen ___________________ ________.
	•	(4) Manu Inmaren ___________________ ________.
	•	(5) Kontxi Mikelen ___________________ ________.
	•	(6) Emilio ___________________ senarra da.

Note: Ibone, Ines, Inma, Josepa, Miren, and Monika are women’s names; Andres, Emilio, Felix, Iker,
Manu, Mikel are men’s names. The letters s and x stand for sounds similar to English sh; z has the
sound of English s, tx of English ch, j is a sound intermediate between g and y; h is mute.

Here is the transcription for Problem 15 (Manam) and the subsequent problems from the “Sample Problem Set”:

Problem 15: Manam

Manam Pile (“Manam Talk”) is a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken on Manam Island off the
coast of Papua New Guinea. Manam is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, and during
violent eruptions the population must be evacuated to the mainland.

[Img 15A attatched]

Below, a Manam islander describes the relative locations of the houses above:

	1.	Onkau pera kana auta ieno, Kulu pera kana ilau ieno.
	2.	Mombwa pera kana ata ieno, Kulu pera kana awa ieno.
	3.	Tola pera kana auta ieno, Sala pera kana ilau ieno.
	4.	Sulung pera kana awa ieno, Tola pera kana ata ieno.
	5.	Sala pera kana awa ieno, Mombwa pera kana ata ieno.
	6.	Pita pera kana ilau ieno, Sulung pera kana auta ieno.
	7.	Sala pera kana awa ilau ieno, Onkau pera kana ata auta ieno.
	8.	Butokang pera kana awa auta ieno, Pita pera kana ata ilau ieno.

Questions:

a.	Onkau’s, Mombwa’s, and Kulu’s houses have already been located on the map above. Who lives in the other five houses?

A: ____
B: ____
C: ____
D: ____
E: ____

b.	Arongo is building his new house in the location marked with an X. 
In three Manam Pile sentences like the ones above, describe the location of Arongo’s house in relation to the three closest houses.

Problem 17: Aymara

Aymara is a South American language spoken by more than 2 million people in the area around
Lake Titicaca, which, at 12,507 feet above sea level, is the highest navigable lake in the world.
Among the speakers of Aymara are the Uros, a fishing people who live on artificial islands, woven
from reeds, that float on the surface of Lake Titicaca.
a. Below, seven fishermen describe their catch. Who caught what? Match the letters in the image to the statements below.
Also, watch out! One of the fishermen is lying.

	1.	“Mä hach’a challwawa challwataxa.”
	2.	“Kimsa hach’a challwawa challwataxa.”
	3.	“Mä challwa mä hach’a challwampiwa challwataxa.”
	4.	“Mä hach’a challwa kimsa challwallampiwa challwataxa.”
	5.	“Paya challwallawa challwataxa.”
	6.	“Mä challwalla paya challwampiwa challwataxa.”
	7.	“Kimsa challwa paya challwallampiwa challwataxa.”

b. Your daily catch is pictured below. Describe it in Aymara, and don’t lie!
