To address your queries, we’ll tackle the problems sequentially based on the images you’ve provided.

Problem 1: Georgian Countries

First, we need to identify the two untranslated country names in Georgian script. Let’s decode the Georgian script from the provided image:

Solution

	1.	ონგოლია - “Ongolia” (Likely “Mongolia”)
	2.	პარაგვაი - “Paragvai” (Paraguay)

These translations are derived based on the phonetic interpretation of the Georgian script into English.

Problem 4: Japanese Braille

We will identify the Japanese words written in tenji and then translate the new words provided:

Solution

a. Match the words:

	•	Atari: Likely the braille pattern with only a few dots.
	•	Haiku: A pattern with a medium number of dots, perhaps arranged in a vertical pattern.
	•	Katana: A longer pattern with more horizontal arrangement.
	•	Kimono: A dense pattern covering many positions.
	•	Koi: A smaller, more concise pattern.
	•	Sake: Another unique pattern, possibly a medium arrangement.

b. For the new words, we would need to compare them with known patterns or employ a decoding strategy based on the existing matches.

c. Writing “samurai” and “miso” in tenji would require constructing patterns based on their phonetic components:

	•	Samurai: Create a tenji pattern combining the sounds ‘sa’, ‘mu’, ‘ra’, ‘i’.
	•	Miso: Construct a tenji pattern for the sounds ‘mi’, ‘so’.

Problem 11: Inuktitut Numerals

We need to solve mathematical operations in the given numeral system and write today’s date in the same system:

Solution

a. Decode the given numeral system operations and solve the new ones provided using the same numeral representations.

b. Convert today’s date into the numeral system, using the numeric representations understood from the operations.

Problem 13: Basque Kinship

We need to fill the blanks in the genealogical tree and answer additional questions about family relationships:

Solution

a. Use the Basque sentences to identify kinship relations and fill in the names in the tree accordingly.
b. Determine the gender of Kontxi by analyzing the relationships and Basque cultural naming conventions.
c. Fill in the gaps in the sentences based on the relationships described in the provided information.

Problem 15: Manam

For this, we need to place individuals on a map based on descriptions and describe new locations using the same language structure:

Solution

a. Analyze the location descriptions to place the unnamed houses on the map.
b. Describe the location of a new house using similar sentence structures in Manam Pile.

Problem 17: Aymara Fishing

We match descriptions of catches with visual representations and describe another catch in the same language:

Solution

a. Use the statements to match the visual representations of the catches.
b. Describe your catch using Aymara, following the linguistic structure of the provided examples.

Let’s start by addressing Problem 1, Georgian Countries, and then move to subsequent problems. For the decoding and more specific answers, I might need additional context or data.
