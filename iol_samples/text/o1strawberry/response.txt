Problem 2

a. Match the Ancient Greek phrase (A-H) with the corresponding English translation (1-8).

First, let’s analyze the Greek phrases and their components:

	•	ho: the (masculine singular nominative)
	•	hoi: the (masculine plural nominative)
	•	tu: of the (masculine singular genitive)
	•	tōn: of the (masculine plural genitive)
	•	dulos: slave
	•	dulōn: of slaves (genitive plural)
	•	cyrios: master
	•	cyriōn: of masters (genitive plural)
	•	hyios: son
	•	hyioi: sons (nominative plural)
	•	hyiōn: of sons (genitive plural)
	•	emporos: merchant
	•	emporu: of the merchant (genitive singular)
	•	adelphos: brother
	•	adelphoi: brothers
	•	adelphōn: of brothers (genitive plural)
	•	onos: donkey
	•	onōn: of donkeys (genitive plural)
	•	oicos: house
	•	oicu: of the house (genitive singular)

Now, match each phrase with its translation:

	1.	A. ho tōn hyiōn dulos — the slave of the sons
	2.	B. hoi tōn dulōn cyrioi — the masters of the slaves
	3.	C. hoi tu emporu adelphoi — the brothers of the merchant
	4.	D. hoi tōn onōn emporoi — the merchants of the donkeys
	5.	E. ho tu cyriu onos — the donkey of the master
	6.	F. ho tu oicu cyrios — the master of the house
	7.	G. ho tōn adelphōn oicos — the house of the brothers
	8.	H. hoi tōn cyriōn hyioi — the sons of the masters

Answer:

	•	A — 1
	•	B — 2
	•	C — 3
	•	D — 4
	•	E — 5
	•	F — 6
	•	G — 7
	•	H — 8

b. Translate into Ancient Greek:

	1.	The houses of the merchants
	•	Houses: oikoi (plural of oicos)
	•	Of the merchants: tōn emporōn (genitive plural of emporos)
	•	Translation: hoi tōn emporōn oikoi
	2.	The donkeys of the slave
	•	Donkeys: onoi (plural of onos)
	•	Of the slave: tou dulou (genitive singular of dulos)
	•	Translation: hoi tou dulou onoi

Final Translations:

a) hoi tōn emporōn oikoi

b) hoi tou dulou onoi

Problem 3: Aragonese

a. Write down the missing words.

Let’s analyze the patterns in singular and plural forms:

	2.	banquet (stool) ➔ banquetz (stools)
	3.	clot (hole) ➔ clotz (holes)
	4.	cantal (stone) ➔ cantals (stones)
	5.	deixau (unhanded) ➔ deixaus (unhanded, plural)
	6.	personache (character) ➔ personaches (characters)
	7.	peix (fish) ➔ peixes (fish, plural)

From these examples, we can deduce:

	•	Words ending with -t become -tz in plural.
	•	Words ending with -l add -s.
	•	Words ending with -au become -aus.
	•	Words ending with -e add -s.
	•	Words ending with -x become -xes.

	•	concordau (awake) ➔ concordaus
	•	chicolat (chocolate) ➔ chicolatz
	•	chunta (union) ➔ chuntas
	•	eclix (eclipse) ➔ eclixes
	•	ferfet (cicada) ➔ ferfetz
