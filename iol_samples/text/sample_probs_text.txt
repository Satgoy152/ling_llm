Problem 9

Japanese Chess (Shōgi ), played on a board of size 9 by 9 and with a total of 40 men, is the most
popular intellectual game in contemporary Japan, where it entertains between 10 and 20 million
people. But between the 8th and 18th century many other variants of the game were invented in that
country, some on smaller and some on larger boards.

The largest of all Japanese chess games (and generally the largest chess game in history) is
Taikyoku Shōgi (more or less “Ultimate Chess”), in which the board is of size 36 by 36 (or 1296
squares in all) and every player has in the beginning an army of 402 men of 208 different types.

This is a table which contains the names of some of the men in Taikyoku Shōgi (in Japanese and
in English translation), as well as the name of the man to which each of them promotes upon
reaching one of the farthest 11 ranks of the board:

Initial value	             Promoted value
1. ______	“Running Stag”  ⟹ honroku ______

Problem 10

Guarani, still spoken today in southern Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay (being co-official
in the later). The table below shows some words in Tupinambá, their translations

Problem 14: Icelandic Kinship

Guðrún Eriksdóttir Hrafnhildardóttir and Jakob Christiansson had three kids, from which they are very proud, for their successes and for all of them have given them grandsons or granddaughters. In order to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary, the long-lived couple had a party with all their descendants: sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, great-grandsons and great-granddaughters.

Problem 18: Toki Pona

Toki Pona is a constructed language, created in 2011 by the Canadian linguist Sonja Elen Kisa.
Her aim was the language to be a minimal language, undervaluing the empty and abstract
communication such as the ones of politicians and bureaucrats and pointing more directly to the
concrete human life experiences. Therefore, the language makes use of only 123 words, with roots
coming from different language families.
What follows is a list of some words and expressions in Toki Pona and, out of order, their English
translations:

kiwen suno jelo, tomo tawa telo, jan Powi, ilo suno, telo jelo, jan ilo, jan toki, supa lape,
supa moku, ma tomo, wile moku, tawa, nasin linja, wile pona, telo kiwen, lipu toki, wile lawa,
linja lawa, tomo moku, linja kiwen

prophet, well-intentioned, hair, lantern, ice, robot, boat, thorn, hungry, Boris, book,
piss, city, bed, orthodoxy, movement, restaurant, dominant, dinner table, gold

Questions:

a.	Do the right associations between the words and translations.
b.	Give the translation of all the simple Toki Pona words used in the compounded words and expressions of this problem.
c.	How would you translate literally the name of the language?
