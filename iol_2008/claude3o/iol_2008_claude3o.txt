Here are the solutions to the computational linguistics problems:
Problem 1:
(a) Transcriptions:
12. gsnqo'qon: [g@s@nqōxon]
13. tg'poq: [tg@b@q]
14. gmu'jmin: [gm@ūjcmin]
15. emtoqwatg: [@mt@qwatk]
16. te'plj: [tēp@lc]
(b) Listuguj orthography:
17. [@tp@dēs@n]: tpd'sn
18. [@mtesk@m]: amtsk'm
19. [alapt@k]: alapt'g
20. [g@lamen]: glam'n
Key observations:

[@] is written as a or e
[c] is written as j
 is written as q
[G] is written as g
[w] indicates rounding of the preceding consonant and is written as '
vowel length is indicated by '

Problem 2:
(a) Rules observed in a dróttkvætt distich:

The first line contains two words beginning with the same sound (alliteration)
The first word of the second line also begins with this alliterating sound
All vowels alliterate with each other and with j

(b) Filled in stanza V:

[smíði] (þreifsk reiddra øxa
[rymr] ; knǫ́ttu spjǫ́r [glymja] )
[svartskyggð] bitu seggi
[sverð] þjóðkonungs ferðar,
þás ( [sigr] hǫlða)
[ríks] [hlaut] [andskoti]
(hǫ́r vas [sǫngr] of [svírum] )
[vigra] (flugbeiddra [hugfyldra] ).

Words that do not belong: Gauta, hœgra
Problem 3:
(a) Correct correspondences:
Drehu - English

drai-hmitrötr - Sunday
gaa-hmitrötr - skeleton
i-drai - sanctuary
i-jun - church
i-wahnawa - calendar
jun - bone

nyine-thin - coast
uma-hmitrötr - awl

Cemuhî - English

a-pulut - spur
ba-bwén - animal
ba-jié - fork
bé-ôdu - pencil
bé-tii - cup
bé-wöli - coast
bé-wöli-wöta - twilight
tii - bed
wöta - to write

(b) Meanings:

Drehu: wahnawa = 'day', drai = 'holy'
Cemuhî: wöli = 'sea', pulut = 'rooster'

(c) Translations from Drehu:

i-bii = 'bee'
tusi-hmitrötr = 'pencil'

Problem 4:
(a) English translations:

caky2sm2tih - only above the vine
k2m2Nšeh - like a shadow
P2s mok - my corn
mis nd2ctaPm - your teeth
pahsunbit - with the squash
perolkotoyašehtaPm - just like kettles

(b) Copainalá Zoque translations:

pokskukotoya
P2s nperol
koc2kšehtih
P2s Ngom
k2m2Nky2sm2
mis nkumguy

Key observations:

Possession is indicated by prefixes (P2s = 'my', mis = 'your')
-taPm = plural
-tih = 'only'
-šeh = 'like'
-bit = 'with'
-kotoya = 'for'
-k2sm2 = 'above'

Problem 5:
(a) English translations:

The wolf saw your shaman.
The polar bears hurt a boy.
You cured the hunters.
You shot the teacher.
You came.
You cured a hunter.

(b) Inuktitut translations:

Angatkuup aanniqtaatit.
Ilinniaqtitsijiup inuuhuktuq takujanga.
Amaruit ukiakhaqtuq.
Qingmirmik qukiqsijutit.
Qingmiit ilinniaqtitsijimik aanniqsijuq.

Key observations:

Ergative-absolutive case system (subject of intransitive verb and object of transitive verb have same case, subject of transitive verb different)
Possession indicated by suffixes on nouns
Verb agrees with both subject and object
-up/-it = ergative case (subject of transitive verb)
-mik = accusative case (object of transitive verb)
-tit/-tait = 2nd person singular/plural subject acting on 3rd person object
-juq = 3rd person singular subject
-juit/-jait = 2nd person singular subject acting on 3rd person singular/plural object
