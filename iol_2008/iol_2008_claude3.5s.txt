Thank you for providing this comprehensive set of computational linguistics problems. I'll work through each problem systematically, providing solutions and explanations.

### Problem 1: Micmac Language

(a) Transcribing words:

12. gsnqo'qon: [g@s@nqōxon]
13. tg'poq: [tg@b@q]
14. gmu'jmin: [gm@ūjmin]
15. emtoqwatg: [@mt@qwatk]
16. te'plj: [tēplj]

(b) Writing in Listuguj orthography:

17. [@tp@dēs@n]: tpud'sn
18. [@mtesk@m]: amt'sg'm
19. [alapt@k]: alapt'g
20. [g@lamen]: glam'n

Explanations:
- In Listuguj orthography, '@' is often represented by apostrophes or omitted.
- Long vowels (ē) are represented by 'e' in Listuguj.
- The sound [x] is represented by 'q' in Listuguj.
- [k] at the end of a word is often written as 'g' in Listuguj.

### Problem 2: Old Norse Poetry

(a) Rules observed in a distich of dróttkvætt:

1. Alliteration: The first line contains two words beginning with the same sound, and the first word of the second line begins with this sound too.
2. All vowels alliterate with one another and with j.
3. Each line seems to have a fixed number of syllables (likely 6).
4. There appears to be a specific stress pattern, possibly with stressed syllables in certain positions.

(b) Filling in the gaps in stanza V:

1. [rymr] (þreifsk reiddra øxa
2. [ríks] ; knǫ́ttu spjǫ́r [glymja] )
3. [svartskyggð] bitu seggi
4. [sverð] þjóðkonungs ferðar,
5. þás ( [hugfyldra] hǫlða)
6. [hlaut] [andskoti] [Gauta]
7. (hǫ́r vas [sǫngr] of [svírum] )
8. [sigr] (flugbeiddra [vigra] ).

The words "hœgra" and "smíði" are not used in this stanza.
