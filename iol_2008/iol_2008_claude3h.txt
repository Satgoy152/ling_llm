Here is my approach to solving the computational linguistics problems:

### Problem 1
(a) Transcription of the Listuguj words:
12. gsnqo'qon: [g@s@nqōxon] (foolishness)
13. tg'poq: [tg@b@q] (spring water) 
14. gmu'jmin: [gm@ūjcın] (raspberry)
15. emtoqwatg: [@mt@qw@tk] (to worship)
16. te'plj: [tēpljc] (goat)

(b) Listuguj orthography:
17. [@tp@dēs@n]: tpe'd'sn (south)
18. [@mtesk@m]: amt'k'm (snake)
19. [alapt@k]: alapt'k (to look around)
20. [g@lamen]: glamn (so, therefore)

The key principles I used are:
- Mapping the provided phonetic transcriptions to the corresponding Listuguj orthography, based on the provided transcription rules.
- For the Listuguj to phonetic transcription, I reversed the process, converting the Listuguj words to the corresponding phonetic forms.

### Problem 2
(a) The main rules of the dróttkvætt meter are:
- The first line of each distich (pair of lines) contains two words beginning with the same sound, and the first word of the second line begins with this sound as well (alliteration).
- All vowels are considered to alliterate with one another and with j.

(b) Filling in the gaps in stanza V:

1. [a] (þreifsk reiddra øxa
2. [b] ; knǫ́ttu spjǫ́r [c] )
3. [d] bitu seggi
4. [e] þjóðkonungs ferðar,
5. þás ( [f] hǫlða)
6. [g] [h] [i]
7. (hǫ́r vas [j] of [k] )
8. [l] (flugbeiddra [m] ).

Answers:
[a] hildiglǫmmu, [b] sár, [c] gǫgnum, [d] fjǫrvi, [e] hildar, [f] ósvipur, [g] ógndjarfir, [h] stǫfnum, [i] fœrðu, [j] vápna, [k] fjǫldum, [l] fljóða, [m] sóknar

The key is to consider the rules of alliteration and the overall meaning to fill in the gaps with the most appropriate words from the provided list.

### Problem 3
(a) Correct correspondences:

**Drehu**
- drai-hmitrötr - wall
- gaa-hmitrötr - sanctuary
- i-drai - calendar
- i-jun - church
- i-wahnawa - ???
- jun - coast
- ngöne-gejë - Sunday
- ngöne-uma - skeleton
- nyine-thin - awl
- uma-hmitrötr - bone

**Cemuhî**
- a-pulut - bed
- ba-bwén - animal
- ba-jié - fork
- bé-ôdu - cup
- bé-tii - pencil 
- bé-wöli - coast
- bé-wöli-wöta - to write
- tii - twilight
- wöta - spur

(b) Possible meanings:
- wahnawa in Drehu - church
- drai in Drehu - calendar
- wöli in Cemuhî - coast
- pulut in Cemuhî - bed

(c) Translations from Drehu to Cemuhî:
- i-bii - a-pulut (bed)
- tusi-hmitrötr - bé-tii (pencil)

The key is to identify the correspondences between the Drehu and Cemuhî words based on the provided translations, and then use that knowledge to translate the new Drehu words.

### Problem 4
(a) Translations to English:
