Here are the solutions to the computational linguistics problems:

Problem 1:

(a) Transcriptions:
12. gsnqo'qon: [g@s@nqōxon] 
13. tg'poq: [tg@b@q]
14. gmu'jmin: [gm@ūcmin]
15. emtoqwatg: [@mt@qwatk] 
16. te'plj: [tēp@lc]

(b) Listuguj orthography:
17. [@tp@dēs@n]: tpde'sn
18. [@mtesk@m]: amtesqm  
19. [alapt@k]: alapt'g
20. [g@lamen]: glam'n

Key observations:
- [c] is represented as j
- [q] is represented as q 
- [@] is often omitted when not stressed
- Apostrophe represents consonant softening/palatalization
- Word-final [k] becomes g in the orthography

Problem 2:

(a) The rules observed in a dróttkvætt distich are:
1. The first line has two words beginning with the same sound (alliteration). 
2. The first word of the second line also begins with this alliterating sound.
3. All vowels alliterate with each other and with j.
4. The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables must be maintained.

(b) The completed stanza V:
1. sverð (þreifsk reiddra øxa
2. rymr; knǫ́ttu spjǫ́r glymja)
3. svartskyggð bitu seggi
4. sǫngr þjóðkonungs ferðar,
5. þás (vigra hǫlða)
6. hugfyldra svírum
7. (hǫ́r vas hœgra of ríks)
8. hlaut (flugbeiddra Gauta).

The two words that don't belong are: andskoti, smíði.

Key observations:
- Alliteration pattern must be maintained in each distich (couplet)
- Grammatical structure and meaning help determine word placement
- Meter and syllabic patterns are important constraints

Problem 3: 

(a) Correct correspondences:

Drehu - English:
- drai-hmitrötr - calendar
- gaa-hmitrötr - Sunday
- i-drai - bone
- i-jun - sanctuary
- i-wahnawa - coast
- jun - church
- ngöne-gejë - awl
- ngöne-uma - wall  
- nyine-thin - coast
- uma-hmitrötr - skeleton

Cemuhî - English:
- a-pulut - spur

- pulut likely means "rooster" 

(c) Translations from Drehu:
- i-bii - bee
- tusi-hmitrötr - bunch of books

Key observations:
- Compounds are formed by combining roots
- i- prefix marks certain nouns
- -hmitrötr suffix indicates a collection or group

Problem 4:

(a) Translations to English:
1. caky2sm2tih - only above the vine
2. k2m2Nšeh - like a shadow  
3. P2s mok - my corn
4. mis nd2ctaPm - your teeth
5. pahsunbit - with a squash
6. perolkotoyašehtaPm - just like kettles

(b) Translations to Copainalá Zoque:
1. pokskukotoya
