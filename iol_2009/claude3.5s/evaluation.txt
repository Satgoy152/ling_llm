Problem 4:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: It's not possible to determine the stress for bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-, and us-ri- because we don't have enough information about how stress is placed on long vowels (ā) or on single-syllable roots.
            Real Answer: This rule applies if the root contains precisely one stop consonant. If there are two (e.g., bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-) or none (us-ri-), the stress cannot be determined.
