I'll be happy to help you solve these computational linguistics problems. Let's go through them one by one:

### Problem 1: Sulka Language

(a) Translating to English:

1. a ksie a tgiang = 1 coconut
2. o ngaitegaap a korlotge = 3 breadfruits
3. o ngausmia a ktiëk = 5 coconuts (ktiëk seems to mean 5)
4. o vuo a lo ktiëk hori orom a tgiang = 11 betel nuts

(b) Translating to Sulka:

1. 2 yams = o sngu a lomin
2. 14 yams = o sngu a lo ktiëk hori orom a korlolo
3. 15 breadfruits = o ngaitegaap a lo ktiëk hori orom a moulang
4. 20 betel nuts = o vuo a mhelom

### Problem 3: Burmese Children's Birthdates

Based on the pattern of names and dates, we can deduce:

- Nwe si6þu (boy): 06/14/2009
- daliya (girl): 06/16/2009
- so mo cO (boy): 06/24/2009
- e ti6 (girl): 07/09/2009
- phyuphyu wi6 (girl): 07/13/2009
- yE au6 nai6 (boy): 07/18/2009

### Problem 4: Old Indic Word Stems

(a) It's not possible to determine the stress for bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-, and us-ri- because we don't have enough information about how stress is placed on long vowels (ā) or on single-syllable roots.

(b) Indicating stress:

- mr.́dh-ra-
- phe-ná-
- stu-tí-
- tan-tí-
- bhār-á-
- dū-tá-
- svap-ná-
- bhū-mí-
- ghar-má-
- abh-rá-
- gha-ná-
- ghr.s.-ví-

### Problem 5: Nahuatl Language

(a) Translating to English:

1. tiktlazohtlaltia in zihuātl in kuauhx̄ınki
   - You make the woman love the carpenter
   - You make the carpenter love the woman

2. nēchtzāhtz̄ıtia
   - He makes me shout

3. tikhūıteki
   - You beat him/her/it

4. nikēhuilia in kikatl in t̄ız̄ıtl
   - I sing the song for the healer

5. nikneki in ātōlli
   - I want the atole

6. mitztlakāhualtia
   - He makes you leave something

(b) Translating to Nahuatl:

1. He makes me prepare the atole = nēchtlach̄ıhualtia in ātōlli
2. You prepare the wine for somebody = tiktētlach̄ıhuilia in oktli
3. The healer makes you sleep = mitzkoch̄ıtia in t̄ız̄ıtl
4. I sing something = nitlakēhua
5. I fall = nihuetzi

These translations are based on the patterns observed in the given examples and the rules of the Nahuatl language as presented in the problem.
