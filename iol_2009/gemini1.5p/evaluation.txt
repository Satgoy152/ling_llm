Problem 4:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The provided data doesn't offer a clear rule for determining stress in the given stems because: bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-, us-ri- don't follow any consistent pattern observed in the data. The data primarily focuses on stress placement within roots and suffixes, while the relationship between stress and specific vowel combinations or syllable structures isn't directly addressed.
            Real Answer: This rule applies if the root contains precisely one stop consonant. If there are two (e.g., bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-) or none (us-ri-), the stress cannot be determined.
