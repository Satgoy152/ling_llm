Problem 4:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: It is not possible to determine the stress placement for these stems because they are monosyllabic roots without sufficient morphological context or stress indicators, and the data does not provide enough information to establish a pattern for stress assignment.
            Real Answer: This rule applies if the root contains precisely one stop consonant. If there are two (e.g., bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-) or none (us-ri-), the stress cannot be determined.
