Problem 4:
    Part a:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The stems provided in the table do not include sufficient information regarding the specific phonetic environment or morphology of the words bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-, and us-ri-. These stems may exhibit variable stress patterns based on their usage in sentences, their inflected forms, and the presence of prefixes or suffixes. Moreover, without a larger corpus of related words or their inflected forms, it is impossible to ascertain consistent stress patterns.
            Real Answer: This rule applies if the root contains precisely one stop consonant. If there are two (e.g., bhāg-a-, pad-a-, pat-i-) or none (us-ri-), the stress cannot be determined.
