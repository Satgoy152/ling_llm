**(b) Meanings of Additional Symbols**

* Symbol 1: **western** (same as the first symbol in the original set)
* Symbol 2: **saliva** (same as the second symbol in the original set)
* Symbol 3: **feeling** (This is likely derived from the "person" indicator combined with an internal element representing emotion/sensation.)
* Symbol 4: **opposite, against** (The angled lines seem to suggest opposition or contrary motion.)
* Symbol 5:  **round, circular** (The circled dot likely represents an enclosed space or shape.)



**(c) Writing in Blissymbolics (Hypothetical)**

Blissymols are constructed logically by combining basic elements. Since we don't have a full Blissymbolics dictionary, the following are educated guesses based on the provided examples and general principles of the system.

* **air:**  Probably a combination of "sky" (which we don't know) and some indicator of substance or invisibility. Perhaps a cloud symbol if one exists, or the "feeling" symbol modified to suggest something intangible.

* **body (torso):**  Likely a simplified depiction of a human torso, perhaps a rectangle or rounded shape.

* **to rise:** An upward arrow.  Possibly combined with the "person" indicator to show a person rising.

* **east:**  The opposite of "western" (symbol 1).  Perhaps the mirrored version of the "western" symbol.

* **sad:** The opposite of "merry" (symbol 7).  Perhaps a downward curving arrow by a circle, or a darkened/shaded version of the "merry" symbol.


**Important Note:** Without a complete Blissymbols chart, these proposed constructions in (c) are speculative. The actual symbols could be different.  A comprehensive resource would be needed for accurate representation.
