| lueatr nge luepi                 | 89    |

(a) Determine the correct correspondences.

(b) Write in numerals:

- köniatr nge eke + caatr nge luepi = ekaatr nge ekako  
- luengömen + luako = ekeqaihano

(c) Write out in Drehu:

- 21  
- 48  
- 83

△! The Drehu language belongs to the Austronesian language family. It is spoken by approx. 10000 people on Lifu Island to the east of New Caledonia. c = ch in church; ng = ng in hang; ö = French eu or German ö; q is a voiceless w (as wh in Scottish or Southern American which); tr ≈ English t in art, uttered with the tip of the tongue turned back.

### Problem 4 (20 points)
One of the major achievements in genetics was the decipherment of the genetic code—the creation of an mRNA–polypeptide dictionary. Polypeptides (proteins) are building blocks of all living organisms. Polypeptide molecules are chains that consist of amino acids (denoted as Arg, Leu, Phe etc.), and it is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide that determines its properties. When cells synthesize polypeptides, they follow instructions written in molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), chains that consist of four nucleotides (denoted as U, C, A, G).

If a cell uses as a template the following mRNA sequence:

AUGUCGAGAAGUCACACCCCACCUUCCGAAUCUAGCCUCAAGAAUCUAGCUCGUGGCCGGAUCUAUACACGAUGAAUGAGGUGGUGUCUUGUGUGCGAGUUAUUCUAAAUGAACCGCUAGAUGGGUCAUGCGCCGGACGUAGGAUUGUUUCAGGCACCCACUAUUCUGUACGUCCAAAUAGAUAAAGUUGCCUCA,

the following polypeptides will be synthesized:

- Met-Ser-Arg-Ser-His-Thr-Pro-Pro-Ser-Glu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Lys-Asn-Leu-Ala-Arg-Gly-Arg-Ile-Tyr-Thr-Arg
- Met-Arg-Trp-Cys-Leu-Val-Cys-Glu-Leu-Phe
- Met-Asn-Arg
- Met-Gly-His-Ala-Pro-Asp-Val-Gly-Leu-Phe-Gln-Ala-Pro-Thr-Ile-Leu-Tyr-Val-Gln-Ile-Asp-Lys-Val-Ala-Ser

(a) A cell uses the following mRNA sequence:
AUGUUAACGUUCUAAAUGUGGGGGGGACACCAG

What polypeptide(s) will it synthesize?

(b) A cell synthesized the following polypeptide:
Met-Lys-Cys-Ile

What mRNA sequence(s) could it have used?

(c) The nucleotide pairs are sometimes called roots and classified into two groups: strong roots and weak roots. Examples of strong roots are CU, GU, AC, GG. Examples of weak roots are AU, UA, UG, AA. Classify all the other roots.


The data presented here are slightly simplified.

### Problem 5 (20 points)
Given are words of two dialects of the Romansh language and their English translations. Some cells have been left blank:

| Sursilvan     | Engadine     | English              |

| culant        | ?            | generous             |

(a) Fill in the gaps.

(b) What is ‘labour’ in Sursilvan, lavur or lavuor? And in Engadine?

(c) In Engadine ‘flowers’ is fluors and ‘parents’ is genituors. You may think that it is the same in Sursilvan, but in fact the words there are flurs and geniturs. How can this be explained?

(d) Translate into both dialects:
- ‘elms’
- ‘angles’

△! Romansh belongs to the Rhaeto-Romance subgroup of Romance. It is one of the four national languages of Switzerland, along with German, French and Italian. It is spoken by
approx. 35 000 people in the canton of Graubünden.
