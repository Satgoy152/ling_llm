Certainly! Let's tackle each problem step by step.

### Problem 1

To solve this problem, we need to identify patterns in the Budukh language verbs provided and fill in the missing forms. The verbs are given in three forms: prohibitive mood (class I), future tense (class II), and future tense (class III). We need to look for regularities or patterns in how these forms are constructed.

1. **Prohibitive mood (class I) patterns**:
    - Forms often start with "a" or "e" and end in "ar" or "al" (e.g., amarxar, amolq̇ol).

2. **Future tense (class II and III) patterns**:
    - Class II often ends in "ura" or "ira" (e.g., arxara, orsura).
    - Class III often mirrors class II, sometimes with slight changes (e.g., arxara, osura).

Based on these observations, we can hypothesize the missing forms:

- "set on (animals)" in prohibitive mood: **ah̨arkar** (following the pattern amarxar)
- "make to roll" in prohibitive mood: **ajölkar** (following the pattern amarxar)
- "lie, recline" in prohibitive mood: **aqalq̇ar** (following the pattern amarxar)
- "bring to a halt" in prohibitive mood: **aquroo1ar** (following the pattern amarxar)
- "be startled" in prohibitive mood: **asonk.ar** (following the pattern amarxar)
- "sit down" in future tense (class II): **alq̇ola**
- "extinguish" in future tense (class II): **emensira** (following the pattern of verbs ending in "si")
- "push" in future tense (class II): **h̨ömörč.ura** (similar to "h̨ümoč. onxu")
- "overtake" in future tense (class III): **čumaraq̇ara** (following patterns in class II)
- "swallow" in future tense (class III): **h̨amolo1ura** (following patterns in class II)
- "remain" in future tense (class III): **ïmankara** (following patterns in class II)
- "cross, go across" in future tense (class III): **jemeč.ira** (following patterns in class II)

### Problem 2

**(a) Determine the correct correspondences:**

Looking at the numerals and their values, we can deduce:

- "caatr nge caako" = 26
- "caatr nge caangömen" = 31
- "caatr nge caaqaihano" = 36
- "ekaatr nge ekengömen" = 42
- "köniatr nge köniko" = 50
- "köniatr nge könipi" = 52
- "köniatr nge köniqaihano" = 73
- "lueatr nge lue" = 75
- "lueatr nge luako" = 78
- "lueatr nge luepi" = 89

From this, we can deduce:
- "caatr" likely represents 20, "ekaatr" represents 40, "köniatr" represents 50, "lueatr" represents 70.
- "caako" represents 6, "caangömen" represents 11, "caaqaihano" represents 16.
- "ekengömen" represents 2, "köniko" represents 0, "könipi" represents 2, "köniqaihano" represents 23.
- "lue" represents 5, "luako" represents 8, "luepi" represents 19.

**(b) Write in numerals:**

- "köniatr nge eke + caatr nge luepi" = 50 + 19 = 69
- "luengömen + luako" = 11 + 8 = 19

Corresponding Drehu:
- "ekaatr nge ekako" = 69
- "ekeqaihano" = 19

**(c) Write out in Drehu:**

- 21 = "caatr nge ekengömen"
- 48 = "ekaatr nge luako"
- 83 = "lueatr nge köniko"

### Problem 4

**(a) mRNA sequence: AUGUUAACGUUCUAAAUGUGGGGGGGACACCAG**

Identify the start codon (AUG) and translate the sequence:

1. AUG = Met
2. UUA = Leu
3. ACG = Thr
4. UUC = Phe
5. UAA = Stop

Thus, the polypeptide synthesized is Met-Leu-Thr-Phe.

**(b) Polypeptide: Met-Lys-Cys-Ile**

Possible mRNA sequences:

1. Met = AUG
2. Lys = AAA or AAG
3. Cys = UGU or UGC
4. Ile = AUU, AUC, or AUA

Possible sequences include:
- AUGAAAUGUAUU
- AUGAAAUGUAUC
- AUGAAAUGUAUA
- AUGAAGUGUUUU
- AUGAAGUGUUUC
- AUGAAGUGUUUA

**(c) Classify the remaining roots:**

Strong roots (contain at least one G or C):
- CC, CG, GC, GG

Weak roots (do not contain G or C):
- AA, AU, UA, UU

### Problem 5

**(a) Fill in the gaps:**

Based on patterns and cognates:

- Sursilvan "elm": **ulma**
- Engadine "stomach": **stom**
- Sursilvan "short": **curt**
- Engadine "world": **mun**
- Sursilvan "tooth filling": **plomba**
- Sursilvan "to show": **mussar**
- Engadine "mountain pass": **fuorcla**
- Sursilvan "generous": **culant**

**(b) 'Labour' in Sursilvan and Engadine:**

- Sursilvan: **lavur**
- Engadine: **lavur**

**(c) Explanation for 'flowers' and 'parents':**

The difference in plural forms (fluors vs. flurs; genituors vs. geniturs) can be due to dialectal variation in pluralization patterns. Sursilvan tends to simplify the vowel structure compared to Engadine, which retains more complex vowel sequences.

**(d) Translate into both dialects:**

- 'elms': 
  - Sursilvan: **ulmas**
  - Engadine: **uolms**

- 'angles':
  - Sursilvan: **anguls**
  - Engadine: **anguls**

These solutions utilize linguistic pattern recognition and logical deduction based on the provided data.
