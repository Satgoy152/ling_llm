    Part c:
        1:
            Classification: Type 3
            LLM Answer: The variations in morphology (e.g. plural forms) can be attributed to historical linguistic changes and dialectal evolution within the Romansh language, leading to differences in suffixes and roots used in each dialect.
            Real Answer: In Sursilvan (unlike Engadine), the first rule doesn't apply in plural forms. This may mean that it doesn't work if one consonant is part of the stem and the other belongs to the ending, or that the vowel is chosen before the ending is added, or that the vowel in the plural is made to match the vowel in the singular.
