### Solution 1:

The Budukh language seems to follow a pattern where the first and last syllables are modified depending on the class of the verb. 

From the given data, we can make several observations:

- For class I masculine form, the first syllable often contains a 'm' and the last syllable often ends with 'r' or 'u'.
- For class II feminine form, the first syllable often contains an 'r' and the last syllable often ends with 'ra'.
- For class III neuter form, the first syllable often contains an 'r' or 's' and the last syllable often ends with 'ra'.

Using these patterns, we can fill in the missing forms:

| Form 1: prohibitive mood  | Form 2: future tense | Form 3: future tense, |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| h̨amarkir                   | h̨arkira             | h̨arkira            |
| jömolkül                  | jölküla         | jölküla           |
| qamalq̇al                  | qalq̇ala           | qalq̇ala            |
| qumuroo1u                  | quroo1ura         | quroo1ura         |
| somonk.on                  | sonk.ona          | sonk.ona          |
| amolq̇ol                   | arq̇ola             | alq̇ola            |
| emensi                    | ersira             | SHADED            |
| h̨ömörč.ü                  | h̨ürč.ura            | SHADED            |
| čumaraq̇ar                 | čaraq̇ara            | SHADED            |
| h̨amolo1u                  | h̨aro1ura            | SHADED            |
| ïmankan                   | ïrkanra             | SHADED            |
| jemeč. i                  | jerč.ira            | SHADED            |

### Solution 2:

Based on the given values, we can derive the numerals for each corresponding number:

| Drehu                    | Value |
|--------------------------|-------|
| caako                    | 1     |
| caatr                    | 5     |
| caangömen                | 6     |
| caaqaihano               | 7     |
| ekaatr                   | 8     |
| ekengömen                | 9     |
| köniatr                  | 10    |
| köniko                   | 11    |
| könipi                   | 12    |
| köniqaihano              | 23    |
| lueatr                   | 25    |
| lue                      | 26    |
| luako                    | 27    |
| luepi                    | 31    |

(a) 

- köniatr nge eke + caatr nge luepi = 10 + 8 + 5 + 31 = 54
- luengömen + luako = 26 + 27 = 53

(b) 

- 21 = caatr nge caako nge caako
- 48 = ekaatr nge ekako nge ekako
- 83 = köniatr nge könipi nge köniqaihano

### Solution 4:

(a) The mRNA sequence AUGUUAACGUUCUAAAUGUGGGGGGGACACCAG will synthesize Met-Leu-Thr-Phe-Met-Trp-Gly-Gly-Thr-Pro.

(b) The polypeptide Met-Lys-Cys-Ile could be synthesized from the mRNA sequences AUGAAAUGUUAU and AUGAAGUGAUAU.

(c) The remaining roots can be classified as follows:

- Strong roots: UC, AG, CG, CC, GG
- Weak roots: AU, UA, UG, AA, GA, GU, UU

### Solution 5:

(a) Based on the given words and their translations, we can attempt to fill in the gaps:

| Sursilvan     | Engadine     | English              |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| um            | uolm         | elm                  |
| stumi         | stomac       | stomach              |
| curt          | cuort        | short                |
| mund          | mond         | world                |
| fuorcla       | fuorcla      | mountain pass        |
| plomba        | plomba       | tooth filling        |
| muossar       | muossar      | to show              |
| culant        | culand       | generous             |

(b) 'Labour' in Sursilvan would likely be 'lavur'. In Engadine, it would likely be 'lavuor'.

(c) The difference in the words for 'flowers' and 'parents' between the two dialects could be due to different linguistic influences or regional variations in pronunciation.

(d) 'Elms' would likely translate to 'umns' in Sursilvan and 'uolms' in Engadine. 'Angles' would likely translate to 'anguls' in Sursilvan and 'anguls' in Engadine.
