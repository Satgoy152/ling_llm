I'll be happy to help you with these computational linguistics problems. Let's go through them one by one:

### Problem 1: Lakhota Language

Let's analyze the patterns in the given sentences to understand the structure of Lakhota:

1. Word order seems to be SOV (Subject-Object-Verb).
2. "ki" appears to be a definite article ("the").
3. "wičha-" prefix seems to indicate plural object.
4. "ma-" prefix for "me" as object, "ni-" for "you" as object.
5. "w-" prefix might indicate "I" as subject.
6. "-pi" suffix seems to indicate plural subject.
7. "čha" appears to mean "and" for connecting clauses.
8. "ną" also means "and" but for connecting phrases within a clause.

Now, let's tackle the assignments:

Assignment 1. Translate into English:

1. wahi čha lakhota ki matho ki wičhačhopi
   "I came, and the Indians called the bears."

3. wičhaša ki nikte čha mačho
   "The person killed you, and (someone) called me."

   "lakhota ki hokšila ki ktepi čha matho ki hi"

   "yahi ną lakhota ki yakte"

3. Whom did I call?

### Problem 2: Catalan Nouns

Assignment 1. Fill the gaps:

1. el bastaix -> els bastaixos
2. el troleibús -> els troleibusos
3. el clos -> els closos
4. el iris -> els iris
5. el llaç -> els llaços
6. el ònix -> els ònixs
7. la pelvis -> les pelvis
8. el pis -> els pisos
9. el sequaç -> els sequaços
10. la sequaç -> les sequaçs
11. el tastaolletes -> els tastaolletes
12. la xeix -> les xeixs

Explanation:
- Nouns ending in -s, -x, -ç generally add -os in plural (e.g., permís -> permisos)
- Some exceptions keep the same form in plural (e.g., cactus, càries)
- Nouns ending in -ix or -x can add -os or -s (e.g., flux -> fluxos, but apèndix -> apèndixs)

Assignment 2. The marks ` and ´ are used to indicate stress on:
- The last syllable if it ends in a consonant other than -s (plural), -n, or -en (verb endings)
- The second-to-last syllable in other cases

Assignment 3. In words without ` or ´, the stress is on:
- The second-to-last syllable if the word ends in a vowel, -s, -n, or -en
- The last syllable if the word ends in any other consonant
