The pattern for brain activity location seems to be connected to the type of word being thought of. Here's the correlation:

- "High" activity in Location A and "Low" activity in all other locations typically indicates a building or structure (e.g., "apartment" or "igloo").
- "High" activity in both Location A and B with "Low" activity in C and D seems to indicate a tool or implement (e.g., "key").
- "High" activity in Location D and "Low" activity in all other locations usually suggests a mode of transportation (e.g., "airplane").
- "Low" activity in all locations except Location C indicates a food item (e.g., "corn" or "cup").
- "Low" activity in all locations except Location B implies a body part (e.g., "arm").
- "High" activity in Location D and "Low" activity in all other locations except Location B usually indicates a tool or implement that also has a function (e.g., "screwdriver").
- "Low" activity in all locations except C and D typically represents a food that is also a plant (e.g., "lettuce").

So, considering these patterns, the six additional words are likely to correspond to the following brain location activities:

| Word          | Location A | Location B | Location C | Location D |
|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| bed (1)      | low        | low        | high       | high       |
| cow (2)      | low        | low        | high       | low        |
| refrigerator (3) | high       | low        | low        | low        |
| butterfly (4)| low        | low        | low        | high       |
| spoon (5)    | low        | high       | high       | low        |
| cat (6)      | low        | low        | low        | low        |
