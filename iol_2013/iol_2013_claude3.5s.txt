To solve this problem, we need to analyze the patterns in the brain activity for different types of words and match them to the new words. Let's break it down:

1) First, let's categorize the known words based on their activity patterns:

   High A, High D: airplane, apartment
   High A only: igloo
   High B, Low A: arm, key
   High B, High D: screwdriver
   High C, Low A/B/D: corn, cup
   High C, High D: lettuce

2) Now, let's look at the new words and try to match them:

   1. Low A, High C, High D: This matches the pattern of 'lettuce', so it's likely 'butterfly'
   2. Low A, High C: This matches 'corn' and 'cup', so it's likely 'cow'
   3. High A, Low B/C/D: This matches 'igloo', so it's likely 'refrigerator'
   4. Low A/B/C, High D: This doesn't exactly match any pattern, but it's closest to 'screwdriver' without the High B. It could be 'bed'
   5. Low A, High B/C: This is a new pattern, but combining 'arm' (High B) and 'corn' (High C), it could be 'cat'
   6. All Low: This is a new pattern, but it's likely the smallest, simplest object - 'spoon'

Therefore, the likely correspondences are:

1. butterfly
2. cow
3. refrigerator
4. bed
5. cat
6. spoon

This solution is based on logical deduction from the given patterns, but it's worth noting that brain activity patterns can be complex and not always perfectly consistent, so there could be some variation in the actual results.
