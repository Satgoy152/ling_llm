Thank you for providing these fascinating computational linguistics problems. I'll work through each one systematically, providing detailed solutions and explanations.

### Problem 1: Ubykh Verb Forms

Let's analyze the patterns in the given Ubykh verb forms:

(a) The other translation for "aŝʷəstʷan" (I give him to you_{pl}) is:
"I give you_{pl} to him"

This is because the order of object pronouns is flexible in Ubykh.

(b) Translating into English:

10. ašʼəntʷən: "he gives me to you_{sg}"
11. səŝʷtʷan: "you_{pl} give me to him"
12. šʼəwənatʷan: "you_{sg} give us to them"

(c) Translating into Ubykh:

13. they give you_{pl} to me: ŝʷəsənatʷən
14. you_{pl} give him to me: asəŝʷtʷan
15. you_{sg} give us to him: šʼawətʷən
16. we give you_{sg} to them: wəšʼantʷən
17. he gives them to us: ašʼtʷan

Pattern observed:
- Verb root: -tʷ- (to give)
- Subject markers: s- (I), w- (we), a- (you_{sg}), ŝʷ- (you_{pl}), ∅- (he/she/it), na- (they)
- Direct object markers: s- (me), šʼ- (us), w- (you_{sg}), ŝʷ- (you_{pl}), a- (him/her/it), na- (them)
- Indirect object markers: -s- (to me), -šʼ- (to us), -w- (to you_{sg}), -ŝʷ- (to you_{pl}), -∅- (to him/her/it), -na- (to them)

The general order is: Subject-IndirectObject-DirectObject-Verb

- si: future tense
- ŋ: first-person singular
- a: second-person singular

(ii) kupaka (sister)
(iii) lhuka (son)
(iv) wardu (child)
(v) kupaka (sister)

- kadnhini: cousin
- thanti: grandparent

### Problem 5: Proto-Chamic, Phan Rang Cham, and Tsat

(a) The Proto-Chamic word *bala would likely have become "pha¹¹" in Tsat if it had survived.

(b) Filling in the blanks:

1. liʔ²⁴
2. taːnʔ⁴²
3. pha⁵⁵
4. ikaʔ
5. kaʔ²⁴
6. tipa
7. pha³³
8. matày
9. taːiʔ⁴²
10. dalam
11. laːnʔ⁴²
12. lapùh
13. phu⁵⁵
14. pulàn
15. phlaːn¹¹
16. pha¹¹
17. phu⁵⁵
18. ta³³

Patterns observed:
- Proto-Chamic *b- often becomes ph- in Tsat
- Proto-Chamic *d- often becomes t- in Phan Rang Cham and disappears in Tsat
- Proto-Chamic *l- often disappears in Tsat
- Tsat often drops initial vowels
- Tones in Tsat correspond to certain consonant endings in Proto-Chamic and Phan Rang Cham

These solutions demonstrate a systematic approach to analyzing linguistic patterns and reconstructing language relationships in computational linguistics.
