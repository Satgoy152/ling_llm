Here are my solutions to the computational linguistics problems:

Problem 1:

(a) The other translation of aŝʷəstʷan is "I give you_{pl} to them".

(b) Translations:
10. ašʼəntʷən - "they give us to you_{sg}"
11. səŝʷtʷan - "you_{pl} give me to him" 
12. šʼəwənatʷan - "they give him to you_{sg}"

(c) Translations into Ubykh:  
13. wəsəŝʷtʷən
14. səŝʷəntʷən
15. šʼawtʷan
16. awəšʼtʷən
17. šʼantʷən

In Ubykh, the verb "to give" agrees with three arguments: giver, gift, and recipient. The giver is marked by a-, wə-, or zero; the gift by -šʼ- "us", -ŝʷ- "me/you_{pl}", -sə- "you_{sg}", or zero "him/them"; the recipient by -n "him/them", -tʷ "you_{sg}" or -tʷən "you_{pl}".

Problem 2:

(a) Correspondences:
1F, 2T, 3Z, 4G, 5U, 6K, 7V, 8Y, 9X, 10A, 11H, 12L, 13B, 14J, 15Q, 16W, 17M, 18R, 19C, 20P, 21O, 22N, 23I, 24S, 25D, 26E

(b) Translations:
27. bállàaka - "they have holes" or "they are torn in several places" 
28. inchafàali - "they are scattered"
29. kawwi - "he peels the bark off"

(c) Translations into Alabama:
30. lómbafka
31. litaffi
32. apòttowi
33. achánnowi

(d) apòttowi can also mean "he turns it upside down".

Observations:
- Verb roots end in one or two consonants.
- a- prefix marks singular object, zero marks plural; -li suffix marks plural subject, zero marks singular  
- kV- prefix (for some V) derives intransitive from transitive
- -ffi suffix adds meaning "in several places" 
- -ka suffix derives stative from active verb
- Tone patterns: H=káwwi, HL=káwwìika, LH=kawáffi, L=kawwi

Problem 3:

(a) Translations:
17. I ask if your_{pl} grandfather calls him.
18. I will not work in Upington.
19. The woman is afraid of my dog.
20. It is you_{pl} whom I will call.
21. Whom do you_{pl} see?
22. Whom do you_{sg} like?

(b) Translations into Nǀuuki:
23. ǁu xaŋki ke si ǃʔai ŋ ɡǀa ǁãu.
24. ɡǀa xae ŋ ǂhun ǃaukea ŋ a.
25. kiɟa xae u si ǂqheeke ŋǁa?  
26. na kacuuʔi ŋ ɡǀu ǃuu xae ŋ ɡǀa ǂʔii ŋǁa.
27. cuu xae si ǀqhõʕo ŋ ǃhaeke? 
28. u ŋǀii ŋ ɡǀi?

Observations:
- Basic word order is SOV, but focused constituent is fronted.  
- ŋ before verb marks yes-no question.
- ke...ŋ around verb marks negation.
- si before verb marks future tense.
- a after verb introduces focused constituent. 
- xae after noun phrase marks focus/question word.
- Independent pronouns: ŋǀŋ "I", ɡǀa "you_{sg}", ɡǀi "we", u "you_{pl}". 
- Possessive pronouns: ŋ "my", ɡǀa "your_{sg}", ɡǀu "our", u "your_{pl}".

Problem 4:

(a) Matching:
A6, B8, C5, D1, E7, F2, G3, H18, I22, J20, K23, L24, M13, N17, O15, P12, Q10, R16, S14, T11, U9, V21, W19, X4

(b) Filled in blanks:
(i) kadnhini
(ii) lhuka
(iii) piyaka
(iv) thanti
(v) kupaka
(vi) nhupa
(vii) wardu
(viii) kaku
(ix) amanyi

Observations:
The kinship terms used:
- kaku: mother's father, woman's daughter's husband 
- amanyi: father's father
- thanti: father's mother, mother's mother
- apityi: father's sister, mother's brother's wife
- nhupa: father, father's brother, husband
- nhuthi: mother, father's brother's wife, wife
- kadnhini: brother's child, woman's sister's child, grandchild
- piyaka: woman's brother's child, man's sister's child
- wardu: man's sister's child, woman's brother's child, woman's father's sister's child
- kupaka: mother's brother
- lhuka: man's child, brother's wife

This suggests a classificatory kinship system typical of Australian languages. Arabana has separate terms for maternal vs paternal grandparents, and offspring of maternal uncle, paternal aunt, vs other siblings.

Problem 5:

(a) If *bala had survived in Tsat, it would have become phia¹¹.

(b) Filled in blanks:
1. liʔ⁴²
2. taːnʔ⁴²
3. pha⁵⁵
4. ikaʔ
5. kaʔ²⁴
6. tapà
7. pha³³
8. mɨtày
9. taːiʔ⁴²  
10. talàm
11. laːnʔ⁴² 
12. lapùh
13. phu⁵⁵
14. pilàn
15. laːnʔ⁴²
16. phia¹¹
17. phu⁵⁵
18. ta³³

Observations:
- Proto-Chamic *a > Phan Rang Cham a, Tsat a
- Proto-Chamic *aː > Phan Rang Cham a, Tsat aː
- Proto-Chamic *b > Phan Rang Cham p, Tsat ph
- Proto-Chamic *d > Phan Rang Cham t, Tsat th (word-initially), t (elsewhere)
- Proto-Chamic *h > Phan Rang Cham h, Tsat Ø
- Proto-Chamic *i > Phan Rang Cham i, Tsat i
- Proto-Chamic *k > Phan Rang Cham k, Tsat k 
- Proto-Chamic *l > Phan Rang Cham l, Tsat l
- Proto-Chamic *m > Phan Rang Cham m, Tsat m (word-initially), n (word-finally)
- Proto-Chamic *r > Phan Rang Cham r, Tsat z
- Proto-Chamic *t > Phan Rang Cham t, Tsat t
- Proto-Chamic *ʔ > Phan Rang Cham ʔ, Tsat ʔ 
- Proto-Chamic *ə > Phan Rang Cham ə, Tsat ə
