Problem 1

To solve this problem, we’ll analyze the given Ubykh verb forms to identify patterns in their morphology, allowing us to translate and construct new forms.

(a) Alternative Translation of Form 9

The ninth form is:

	9.	aŝʷəstʷan — I give him to you_{pl}

Upon analysis, this form can also be translated as:

	•	I give you_{pl} to him

This is because Ubykh verb morphology allows for ambiguity in the order of direct and indirect objects when certain prefixes are used.

(b) Translations into English

Let’s break down each form to translate them accurately.

10. ašʼəntʷən

	•	a-šʼə-n-tʷən
	•	a-: First person singular subject (I)
	•	šʼə-: Third person singular direct object (him)
	•	n-: First person singular indirect object (me)
	•	tʷən: Verb root (give)
	•	Translation: I give him to me

However, since giving something to oneself is unusual, it’s more plausible that n- here represents a plural indirect object (us), leading to:

	•	Alternative Translation: I give him to us

11. səŝʷtʷan

	•	sə-ŝʷ-tʷan
	•	sə-: Third person singular subject (he)
	•	ŝʷ-: Second person plural direct object (you_{pl})
	•	tʷan: Verb root (give)
	•	Translation: He gives you_{pl} to them

12. šʼəwənatʷan

	•	šʼə-wə-na-tʷan
	•	šʼə-: Second person singular subject (you_{sg})
	•	wə-: Third person plural direct object (them)
	•	na-: First person singular indirect object (me)
	•	tʷan: Verb root (give)
	•	Translation: You_{sg} give them to me

(c) Translations into Ubykh

We’ll construct Ubykh verb forms using the identified prefixes.

Prefixes:

	•	Subject Prefixes:
	•	a-: I
	•	wə-: We/They
	•	sə-: He
	•	sa-: You_{sg}
	•	ŝʷə-: You_{pl}
	•	Direct Object Prefixes:
	•	s-: You_{sg}
	•	n-: Us
	•	wə-: Them/Him
	•	ŝʷə-: You_{pl}
	•	Indirect Object Prefixes:
	•	na-: Me
	•	šʼ-: Him
	•	ŝʷə-: You_{pl}

13. They give you_{pl} to me

	•	Prefixes: wə- (they) + ŝʷə- (you_{pl} direct object) + na- (me indirect object)
	•	Verb Form: wəŝʷənatʷən

14. You_{pl} give him to me

	•	Prefixes: ŝʷə- (you_{pl}) + šʼ- (him direct object) + na- (me indirect object)
	•	Verb Form: ŝʷəšʼnatʷən

15. You_{sg} give us to him

	•	Prefixes: sa- (you_{sg}) + n- (us direct object) + šʼ- (him indirect object)
	•	Verb Form: sanšʼtʷən

16. We give you_{sg} to them

	•	Prefixes: wə- (we) + s- (you_{sg} direct object) + wə- (them indirect object)
	•	Verb Form: wəswətʷan

17. He gives them to us

	•	Prefixes: sə- (he) + wə- (them direct object) + n- (us indirect object)
	•	Verb Form: səwəntʷan
