Let's start by solving Problem 1 related to Ubykh:

### Problem 1:

**Part (a)**  
The last of the nine forms "aŝʷəstʷan" translates as "I give him to you_{pl}". Its other translation could logically be "I give them to you_{pl}" considering the plurality indicated by "you_{pl}". This is based on the pattern observed in other Ubykh translations where the plurality of pronouns and objects varies.

**Part (b)**  
Translate into English:
- **10. ašʼəntʷən**: Looking at the patterns:
  - "a-" commonly appears in the 1st person singular "I"
  - "šʼ" is observed in a 1st person plural context "we"
  - "əntʷən" might suggest a verb form related to giving to a plural group.
  - Thus, a possible translation could be "I give them to us".
- **11. səŝʷtʷan**: Based on similar patterns:
  - "sə-" indicates a 3rd person singular "he"
  - "ŝʷ" is found in contexts indicating "you_{pl}" as the recipient.
  - Thus, "he gives me to you_{pl}".
- **12. šʼəwənatʷan**: By the patterns:
  - "šʼ" indicates "he gives"
  - "əwənatʷan" resembles forms related to "they give you_{sg} to me".
  - Possible translation: "he gives us to you_{sg}".

**Part (c)**  
Translate into Ubykh:
- **13. they give you_{pl} to me**: Resembling "wəsənatʷən" ("they give you_{sg} to me"), the plural form could be "wəsənatʷən" with a different pronoun modification for "you_{pl}".
- **14. you_{pl} give him to me**: Resembling "sawtʷən" ("you_{sg} give me to them"), with appropriate modifications, could be "səwətʷən".
- **15. you_{sg} give us to him**: Following the pattern of "sawtʷən", possibly "sawəntʷən".
- **16. we give you_{sg} to them**: Referring to "wəšʼtʷən" ("we give you_{sg} to him"), adjusting for "them" could be "wəšʼəntʷən".
- **17. he gives them to us**: Following "šʼantʷan" ("he gives us to them"), an inverse could be "šʼəwəntʷan".

Now, let's solve the other problems in subsequent turns.
