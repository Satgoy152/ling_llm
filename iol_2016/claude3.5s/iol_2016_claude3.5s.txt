I'll analyze the responses and the map to determine the directional terms used in Aralle-Tabulahan, then fill in the gaps accordingly.

From the given responses, we can deduce:

- bete' = upriver
- sau = downriver
- pano = across (on the same elevation)
- tama = inward (towards the river)
- naung = down (to lower elevation)
- dai' = up (to higher elevation)

Now I'll fill in the gaps:

Kahangang:
- Lamaoä' dai' di Palempang.

Kombeng:
- Lamaoä' bete' di Palempang.

Kota:
- Lamaoä' bete' di Bulung.
- Lamaoä' tama di Sohongang.

Palempang:
- Lamaoä' bete' di Bulung.
- Lamaoä' sau di Kota.
- Lamaoä' naung di Pahihuang.

Bulung:
- Lamaoä' sau di Kota.
- Lamaoä' naung di Pikung.

Panampo:
- Lamaoä' dai' di Kota.

Pikung:
- Lamaoä' dai' di Bulung.
- Lamaoä' dai' di Kahangang.
- Lamaoä' dai' di Panampo.

Tamonseng:
- Lamaoä' dai' di Kahangang.
- Lamaoä' bete' di Palempang.

These translations are based on the relative positions and elevations of the hamlets as shown on the map, using the directional terms deduced from the given responses.

### Problem 2: Luwian Hieroglyphs

(a) Matching Roman script to hieroglyphic forms:

1 ~ HV
2 ~ EU

2. f4_ corresponds to 'hand' (istaris)

(c) Functions of Luwian symbols:

1. ´: Likely a phonetic complement or determinative

4. t: Could be a verbal marker or tense indicator
5. s: Appears to be a common ending, possibly a nominative case marker
6. T: Might represent a specific consonant sound
7. 5: Could be a logogram for a common concept

(c) Translating to Iatmül:
1. pig - ka'ik
2. banana leaves - vaala ni'bu
3. sun - nyaka'ik
4. white people - walini'bana
