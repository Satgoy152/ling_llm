Thank you for providing this fascinating set of computational linguistics problems. I'll work through them step-by-step, providing my analysis and solutions.

### Problem 1: Nahuatl and Arammba Numerals

Let's start by analyzing the number system for each language:

For Nahuatl:
- pöhualli seems to mean 20
- tzontli appears to be 400
- xiquipilli seems to be 8000

For Arammba:
- yànparo appears to be 2
- tambaroy seems to be 3
- yenówe looks like 4
- nimbo might be 5
- tarumba seems to be 10
- ndamno appears to be 1000
- weremeke might be 8

Now, let's solve each part:

(a) Writing equalities (1-12) and numbers (13-16) in numerals:

1. 11 × 10 = 110
2. 20 × 2 = 40
3. 67 + 14 = 81
4. 5 + 2 = 7
5. 13 × 3 = 39
6. 5 × 3 = 15
7. 5 + 5 = 5 × 2
8. 5 + 1 = 3
9. 2 + 1 = 3
10. 4 × 4 = 16
11. 5 × 2 = 10
12. 5 + 2 = 4
13. 1671 = 1000
14. 432 = 20
15. 400 = 13
16. 8000 = 8000

(b) Writing out in Nahuatl:
42: öm-pöhualli-om-öme
494: cen-tzontli-on-näuh-pöhualli-on-mahtlactli-on-nähui

(c) Writing out in Arammba:
43: tarumba yànparo fete
569: weremeke nimbo yànparo tarumba yenówe

### Problem 2: Beslenei Dialect of Kabardian

Let's analyze the structure of the verbs:

- me- seems to be a present tense marker
- -f- appears to indicate ability
- -pe seems to mean "really"
- -fe might mean "pretending"
- -q̇əm seems to be a negation marker
- -t looks like a past tense marker
- -xe might be a plural marker

Now, let's translate:

(a) 
1. ʒeq̇én: to bite
2. medéf: (he/she) is able to sew
3. medáfe: (he/she) is pretending to sew
4. səfə́n: to be able to burn
5. megʷəš'ə́ʔe: (he/she) is speaking
6. mebə́b: (he/she) is flying

(b)
1. c̣ent𝑥ʷéfme: if (he/she) is able to slide
2. šxáfexeq̇əm: (they) aren't pretending to eat
3. bəbə́ft: (he/she) was able to fly
4. šxet: (he/she) was eating
5. ṭəgʷərəgʷə́peme: if (he/she) really is trembling

(c)
1. máde𝑥e
2. mebəbáfe𝑥e
3. sə́pet
4. šxéfq̇əm
5. gʷəš'əʔé𝑥eme
6. meʒéq̇e𝑥e

### Problem 3: Soundex Algorithm

(a) The Soundex algorithm appears to work as follows:

1. Retain the first letter of the name.
2. Remove all occurrences of a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w unless it's the first letter.
3. Assign numbers to the remaining letters:
   1 = b, f, p, v
   2 = c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z
   3 = d, t
   4 = l
   5 = m, n
   6 = r
4. If two or more letters with the same number are adjacent, keep only the first letter.
5. Keep the first three numbers after the initial letter.
6. If you don't have three numbers, pad with zeros.

(b) Matching surnames with Soundex codes:

Allaway - A400
Anderson - A536
Ashcombe - A251
Buckingham - B252
Chapman - C155
Colquhoun - C425
Evans - E152
Fairwright - F623
Kingscott - K523
Lewis - L200
Littlejohns - L342
Stanmore - S356
Stubbs - S312
Tocher - T260
Tonks - T520
Whytehead - W330

(c) Generating Soundex codes for the given surnames:

Ferguson - F622
Fitzgerald - F326
Hamnett - H553
Keefe - K100
Maxwell - M240
Razey - R200
Shaw - S000
Upfield - U143

### Problem 4: Wambaya Language

Analyzing the structure:

- -lu, -ba, -jba seem to be verb endings
- nga, ngu, nya, nyu, gininga, gininya appear to be pronoun forms
- -waji seems to mean "without"
- -ngunya appears to mean "with"

Now, let's translate:

(a) 
18. The old woman will find you.
19. He left you.
20. The dog is without a stick.
21. You stole the girl.
22. He struck you.
23. He jumped with the spear.

(b)
24. Yagujba nguyunya.
25. Gulugba ga ngunybulugi.
26. Bardbi gu juwani gijilulungunya.
27. Ngirra gu janji.
28. Ngajbi gininga alangani.

### Problem 5: Somali Poetry (Masafo)

(a) The structure of a masafo half-line appears to be:

- It consists of 4 syllables.
- The last syllable is always long (ends in a long vowel or a consonant).
- The first three syllables can be either short or long.
- There must be at least one long syllable among the first three.

(b) Genuine half-lines:

36. war ismaaciil daarood
37. dir miyaad wadaagtaan
40. adiga iyo deriskaa
41. digaxaarka mariyoo
44. kala deyaayaa miyaan

Rearranged half-lines:

38. labadaad ka duudiye
39. ka jannadaad daahiye
42. ciid iyo doolo diraac
43. nooma keeneen darka
45. wuxuun kaa danqaabaan

These solutions are based on the patterns and structures observed in the given data. The analysis of the Somali poetry structure is particularly interesting, as it requires careful observation of syllable patterns and lengths.
