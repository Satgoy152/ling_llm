Sure, let’s work through each problem systematically.

Problem 1

(a) Fill in the gaps in rows 15–18.

To find the missing forms, we can analyze the given verbs in Form 1 and Form 2. It seems that the verbs in Form 1 are often modified by a common pattern to derive Form 2.

	1.	netkay’ → ɨnɛtk’ay (push)
	2.	kɨrɨy’ → ɨŋk’ir’a (pull)
	3.	p’uhruy’ → ɨmp’uhra’i (make holes)
	4.	her’oy → ɨndher’o (smooth out)

Thus, the completed table for rows 15–18 is as follows:

Form 1	Form 2	Translation
15. netkay’	ɨnɛtk’ay	push
16. kɨrɨy’	ɨŋk’ir’a	pull
17. p’uhruy’	ɨmp’uhra’i	make holes
18. her’oy	ɨndher’o	smooth out

(b) Fill in the gaps in rows 39–48.

	1.	her’oŋ → ɨnher’o (I smoothed out)
	2.	ɨniʂpaʔ → ɨniʂp’a (I leave)
	3.	aplaʔ → ɨnapl’a (it is being opened)
	4.	ɨŋkaʔ → ɨŋkaʔ (it chose it)
	5.	ɨmbir’a → ɨmbir’a (I saw it)
	6.	ɨnapal’a → ɨnapal’a (I plant it)
	7.	ɨŋk’an’a → ɨŋk’an’a (it was trapped)
	8.	ɨnhɨk’a → ɨnhɨk’a (I leaped)
	9.	ɨnipal’a → ɨnipal’a (I was bathed)

Thus, the completed table for rows 39–48 is:

Form	Translation
39. her’oŋ	I smoothed out
40. ɨniʂpaʔ	I leave
41. aplaʔ	It is being opened
42. ɨŋkaʔ	It chose (it)
43. ɨmbir’a	I saw (it)
44. ɨnapal’a	I plant (it)
45. ɨŋk’an’a	It was trapped
46. ɨnhɨk’a	I leaped
47. ɨnipal’a	I was bathed

Problem 2

(a) Translate into English:

	17.	uwa xinhikaru sytu → “I gave the girl my canoe.”
	18.	txipary nhinhikary → “He drank my blood.”
	19.	kyky aikute pysykary ywamukary → “The man brought the girl’s eye to me.”

(b) This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct form would be:

20. uwa umynary kanawa ximakymukary
Explanation: The verb structure is incorrect. The verb “kanawa” is not correctly linked to the subject “I” and the verb “ximakymukary” needs to reflect the object in a more coherent manner. The correct sentence could be:
“I brought your canoe to the girl.”
Translation: “I brought your canoe to the girl.”

(c) Translate into Apurinã in two ways:

	21.	“You_{sg} found the house.” →

	•	nuta ukyhita na nyi
	•	nyihita na ɨka

	22.	“I brought your_{sg} canoe to the girl.” →

	•	nuta sykaru uamukary
	•	nuta xinhikaru uamukary

	26.	“You_{sg} ate my banana.” →

Problem 3

(a) Translate into English:

	18.	e-ɣuyanah → “I shuddered.”
	19.	ba-ihwin → “You_{pl} cried.”
	20.	nambum-kisaɣah → “We really floated to the surface.”
	21.	bat-ɣadawn → “You_{sg} left behind.”
	22.	ubamum-kolewn → “I silenced you_{sg}.”

(b) Translate into Coastal Marind:

	23.	“He floated to the surface.” → a-ɣuyakum
	24.	“Aw, you_{sg} returned.” → ob-dahetok
	25.	“Oh, I silenced him!” → naka-huɣanab
	26.	“He really chased us away.” → a-nambe-otab
	27.	“You_{pl} really spat on us in vain.” → e-keseh

Problem 4

(a) Translate into English:

	22.	ē-wāpamikoyēk → “if you_{sg} see him”
	23.	ninakinikonān → “we stop them”
	24.	kikakwēcimāwāw → “they help you_{pl}”
	25.	kiwīcihitināwāw → “if you_{sg} help them”

(b) Translate into Plains Cree:

	26.	“if we ask them” → ē-nikakwēcimān
	27.	“they challenge you_{pl}” → nimawinēskomik
	28.	“they help me” → kiwīcihikowāw
	29.	“you_{sg} see them” → kiwāpaminā
	30.	“I stop you_{pl}” → ninakināwak

Problem 5

(a) Write in digits:

	•	kampwɔhii shuunni na kɛ → 15
	•	ŋkuu na baataanre → 109

(b) Write out in the Supyire language:

	•	15 → baashuunni
	•	109 → beɲjaaga na baataanre
	•	152 → beɲjaaga na kɛ na beɲjaaga
	•	403 → baashuunni na kɛ na kaŋkuro
	•	1534 → kampwoo na ŋkwuu shuunni na kɛ na baaricyɛɛre
